I thought if there were a set a rules with criteria developed by emergency physicians, for emergency physicians, they would help this problem and shorten emergency department wait times and costs.</p>\n<p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Ottawa Ankle Rule? Are there cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p>As a general rule in the emergency department, x-rays are rarely useful because most injuries are soft tissue, and an x-ray does not show ligament injury.</p>\n<p><strong>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the Ottawa Ankle Rule besides imaging, or when imaging is negative?</strong></p>\n<p>If the rule states imaging is required, rarely does a patient need both an ankle and foot x-ray, just one or the other or neither. If negative, most patients will heal quickly from a soft tissue ankle injury, but some may require physical therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some situations in which you see clinicians interpreting the rule improperly or incorrectly leading to inappropriate x-ray utilization?</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes doctors don't properly assess the patient's ability to bear weight on their injured ankle. Most patients can and will walk, but it may take a little encouragement from the physician.</p>"
