            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) scale was developed in the 1950s based on questions used by healthcare providers in the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit in Cardiff, Wales, and was first referred to in a manuscript in 1952 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1987525/\" target=\"_blank\">Fletcher 1952</a>). The original MRC scale was developed from these clinical questions and used in numerous research studies over the past 60 years. The MRC was modified in a study in 1988, generating the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale.</p> <p>The original study of the mMRC involved 161 patients with shortness of breath at a single medical center (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3342669\" target=\"_blank\">Mahler 1988</a>). Of the 161 patients, a diagnosis for their dyspnea could only be determined in 153 patients, who constituted the research cohort. Patients’ mMRC scores were compared to other dyspnea measures (BDI and OCD) and spirometric results (FEV₁, FVC, and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures). Inter-rater reliability of the mMRC was 98% in this study, and the mMRC was moderately to strongly correlated with the OCD and BDI indices. mMRC moderately correlated with pulmonary function measurements.</p> <p>A subsequent validation study of 161 patients at a single outpatient clinic in Japan demonstrated factor grouping of the mMRC with other dyspnea measurements (BDI and OCD) and healthcare related quality of life (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9769280\" target=\"_blank\">Hajiro 1998</a>). Furthermore, mMRC scores moderately to strongly correlated with functional assessments of patients’ cardiopulmonary fitness (including FEV₁, <abbr title='Residual volume'>RV</abbr>/<abbr title='Total lung capacity'>TLC</abbr>, and <abbr title='Maximal oxygen consumption'>VO₂max</abbr>).</p> <p>Subsequent single center and small to moderate sized studies, have consistently demonstrated moderate correlations between the mMRC and other dyspnea scores (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2714566/\">Chhabra 2009</a>). mMRC scores have been shown to be highly correlated with health care associated quality of life, particularly for patients with COPD (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884681/\" target=\"_blank\">Henoch 2016</a>). However, correlations between mMRC scores and spirometric results, ABG results, or 6 minute walk distance were not noted in some studies, such that the association between mMRC results and functional metrics is uncertain (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2714566/\" target=\"_blank\">Chhabra 2009</a>).</p>",
