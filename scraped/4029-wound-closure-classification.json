The review concluded that delayed primary closure (DPC) may represent a simple, reliable, and potentially cost-effective way of reducing SSI, but the analysis was inconclusive due to the poor study designs, high risk of bias, and clinical heterogeneity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The RCTs included 623 patients with various abdominal wounds: post-appendectomy, repair of perforated hollow viscus injury, ileostomy closure, trauma, and intra-abdominal abscess or other peritonitis.</li>\n<li>The RCTs had varying time to review for DPC patients (2&ndash;5 days postoperatively), criteria to continue DPC, and definitions of wound infection.</li>\n<li>The review noted a high rate of heterogeneity (77%) between the study designs of the RCTs. When controlling for the heterogeneity, the risk of surgical site infection (SSI) was reduced in patients with DPC (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.40-0.93; p=0.02). However, when accounting for the heterogeneity, the risk of SSI in DPC patients was no longer significant (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.25-1.64, p=0.36).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26558667\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Halawi and Morwood</a> performed an evidence-based review of the acute management of open fractures. When looking specifically at the timing of wound closure, the review referenced the following 2 studies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6337266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benson et al&rsquo;</a>s double-blind prospective study of 82 open fractures found no increased risk of infection when wound closure was delayed for 5 days postoperatively in highly contaminated fractures while receiving prophylactic antibiotics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11041582\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gopal et al</a> retrospectively reviewed 84 patients with Gustilo type IIIB (extensive soft tissue damage with inadequate coverage) and IIIC (arterial injury requiring repair) open tibia fractures who underwent debridement, fracture fixation, and vascularized muscle flap either within or 72 hours after injury (early vs delayed). The study concluded that the low rates of infections in the early fracture fixation and flap coverage group supported the concept that delayed coverage was not necessary if healthy soft tissue can be imported reliably into the zone of injury.</li>\n<li>Similar to abdominal closures, the review concluded that questions still persist regarding primary closure vs delayed primary closure of open fractures.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",
