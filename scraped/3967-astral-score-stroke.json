The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was non-significant in all cohorts, indicating a well-calibrated score (derivation, <em>p </em>= 0.43; Athens, <em>p </em>= 0.22; Vienna,<em> p </em>= 0.49).</p>\n<p>The ASTRAL Score was determined to have the following specificities, sensitivities, and positive and negative predictive values for determining functional outcome (mRS 3&ndash;6) at 90 days at the cut-points below.

Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p>Our daily work with acute stroke patients taught us that our gut feeling about which patient would recover well was wrong in about a third of patients.</p>\n<p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the ASTRAL Score? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p>Like with every score, it is not perfect and surprisingly short for a complex problem, which is long-term prognosis after stroke. Our two pieces of advice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Always use it together with other information that may not be in the score, and</li>\n<li>Use the score only for patients with pre-stroke independence (<calculator id=\"1890\">Modified Rankin Scale</calculator> 0-2 points). Patients who were already dependent before the stroke will <g class=\"gr_ gr_44 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"44\" data-gr-id=\"44\">in general</g> remain so after three months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the ASTRAL Score? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p>The information of the calculated score should add to, not replace, the estimation of prognosis.</p>\n<p>We have already shown that adding basic imaging information adds little to the score. However, we feel that adding subacute clinical information, such as the <calculator id=\"715\">NIHSS</calculator> or temperature at 24 hours, could add further precision to the score.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you use the ASTRAL Score in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p>We use it in the acute phase when discussing difficult situations with the next of kin. For example, \"Your mother, who was still at home, now had a moderately severe stroke; from our estimation, she has an approximately 60% chance of being dependent (or dead) in three months. Does this help you in your wish for how aggressive we should be in our management in the next few days in the stroke unit?\"</p>\n<p><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you&rsquo;re particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently nearly finished with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new score predicting stroke recurrence in the first 12 months after an ischemic stroke.</li>\n<li>A new clinical prehospital score which predicts not only which patients have a large (proximal) vessel occlusion for possible thrombectomy, but also does so up to 24 hours, and predicts who has a good chance of responding to thrombectomy.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>"
