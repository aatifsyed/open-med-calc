He derived and applied the BPP to 216 high-risk pregnancy patients and compared their perinatal outcomes. Results suggested that BPP can be an accurate method of antepartum fetal evaluation.</p> <p>A subsequent study was performed in 2,712 patients receiving 7,851 tests of BPP evaluation but with reduced use of non-stress test (NST). Results showed no measurable change in test accuracy if other four ultrasound parameters are normal. Therefore, NST can be omitted and presumed normal if ultrasound parameters are normal (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3548386\" target=\"_blank\">Manning 1987</a>).</p> <p>Kim et al validated the BPP Score in 100 patients with singleton pregnancies in active labor phase. Results showed that BPP is a good predictor for cesarean delivery and need for NICU admission. The use of oxytocics, prostaglandins, or epidural anesthesia did not influence BPP score (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12962926\" target=\"_blank\">Kim 2003</a>).</p> <p>A modified BPP exists, which takes less time to perform and seems to have similar accuracy in predicting perinatal outcome (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8203424\" target=\"_blank\">Nagoette 1994</a>). Still, the full BPP provides more detailed information to help decision-making when facing suspected fetal distress.</p>",
