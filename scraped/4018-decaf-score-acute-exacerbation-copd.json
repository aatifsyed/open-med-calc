From this cohort five independent variables with the strongest predictive ability for in-hospital mortality were selected to create the DECAF Score.</p>\n<p>Recruited patients were &ge;35 years of age, had &ge;10 pack-year smoking history, evidence of preadmission airflow limitation (FEV₁/FVC &lt;0.70) and were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD. Excluded patients were those with a comorbidity expected to limit survival to less than 12 months and those on home oxygen.</p>\n<p>The DECAF Score was internally validated and performed well to predict in-hospital mortality. It was later <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26769015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">externally validated</a> in two cohorts of patients. The first cohort consisted of 880 patients from the same hospitals as the original derivation study. The second cohort included 845 patients from 4 different hospitals in the UK.</p>\n<p>In both of these validation cohorts, the DECAF Score performed well to predict in-hospital mortality and again bested other scoring systems including <calculator id=\"4019\">BAP-65</calculator>, CAPS, <calculator id=\"1868\">APACHE II</calculator>, and <calculator id=\"324\">CURB-65</calculator>.</p>",

Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) disrupt patients' lives, are a very common reason for hospital admission and have a significant in-hospital mortality rate. Clinicians' estimates of prognosis in patients hospitalized with ECOPD are frequently inaccurate. We developed the DECAF score because a simple, reliable, accurate prediction tool could potentially improve patient care, by identifying patients suitable for hospital discharge or for more intensive therapy / monitoring.</p> <p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the DECAF Score? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DECAF is simple to calculate and apply at the bedside. It requires an assessment of the patient&rsquo;s usual level of breathlessness and function: the eMRCD score. Errors can be made by misclassification of the eMRCD. eMRCD records an individual's level of breathlessness when they are stable; i.e., \"on a good day, during the preceding 3 months.\" </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, eMRCD 5a is defined by an individual who is \"Too breathless to leave their house unassisted but independent in washing and/or dressing\"; eMRCD 5b indicates a patient who is \"Too breathless to leave the house unassisted and requires help with washing and dressing.\" Simple walking aids do not constitute assistance but wheelchairs and mobility scooters do.</p> <p><strong>How do you use the DECAF Score in your own clinical practice? </strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify low risk patients (DECAF 0-1) who are suitable for hospital at home or early supported discharge. We have performed an RCT of <a href=\"http://www.hospitalathome.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hospital at Home</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> versus usual care, with patient selection by DECAF Score. This is awaiting publication.</p> <p><strong>Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify high risk patients that may need dual antibiotics and early input from critical care, with close monitoring.</p> <p><strong>What score do you assign to patients who cannot complete the eMRCD (intubated, demented, acute encephalopathy)?</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eMRCD score refers to the level of activity from the past three months. Therefore, we would assess the eMRCD using information obtained from: recent outpatient clinic records; patient relatives, carers or friends; or the patient's primary care practitioner.</p>"
