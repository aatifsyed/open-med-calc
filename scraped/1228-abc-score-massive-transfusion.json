The study population was derived from all trauma patients (n = 596) admitted to the hospital over the course of a year. Patients included were level I trauma activations transported directly from the scene who received any blood transfusion while admitted. The ABC Score was created by the trauma faculty based on clinical experience, and logistic regression modeling was used to determine the odds ratio of requiring MTP for each parameter of the score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of the total cohort, 76 patients (12%) required massive transfusion in the first 24 hours. Based on the number of patients who received massive transfusion that were identified using the ABC Score, researchers found the best cutoff to be a score &ge;2, giving a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86%. Compared with the <calculator id=\"1236\">Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage (TASH)</calculator> scoring system and the McLaughlin Score using the same dataset, the ABC Score was shown to be the most accurate in predicting need for MTP.</p>\n<p>The validation study (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20622617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cotton 2010</a>) was a retrospective review using trauma databases from three institutions: Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Parkland Memorial Hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as the original study. The study population was once again derived from trauma patients admitted to one of the three hospitals over the course of a year. The sample size of the study was 1,604 and included 586 patients from the original study. There was significant variation in demographics between the centers involved, but the massive transfusion rate in the first 24 hours of admission was similar (~15%) for each hospital. There was little variability between each institution&rsquo;s cohort in the percentage of patients correctly classified as meeting the ABC cutoff for MTP who received massive transfusions. Sensitivity ranged from 76-90% and specificity 67-87% for each institution. NPV was 97% and the PPV was 55%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The validation study also measured the accuracy of the ABC Score to predict need for massive transfusion in the first 6 hours of admission.&nbsp; Sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 82% with slightly higher NPV (98%) and lower PPV (55%) compared to prediction of massive transfusion need in the first 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The major limitation to both studies was their retrospective nature. A prospective trial is ongoing. The study shows a novel means of quickly predicting the need for massive transfusion based on objective measures. While there is good data showing early activation of MTP improves survival rates in severely injured trauma patients, a prospective study will be necessary to determine if utilization of the ABC Score improves patient outcomes.</p>",

Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p>Once adopted or incorporated into a prehospital or ED massive transfusion protocol, one can evaluate for impact on <g class=\"gr_ gr_54 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"54\" data-gr-id=\"54\">timing</g> of delivery of products and for potential wastage. While it was developed to determine <g class=\"gr_ gr_56 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"56\" data-gr-id=\"56\">successful</g> prediction of patients who would receive 10 units of RBCs, many major transfusions involve less than 10 units in the current 1:1:1 paradigm where we get hemostasis much sooner.</p>\n<p>What we have done is look at predicting those who receive one cooler of products (6 RBCs, 6 plasma, \"6-pack\" platelets), rather than 10 units of RBCs. At the end of the day, it's about having the products your patient needs at the bedside when you need them and not waiting for them. You can always send the products back if you don't end up needing/using them (and should in an expeditious manner).</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you develop the ABC Score? Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p>We developed the ABC Score to help to remind physicians to activate their massive transfusion protocol (MTP) quicker. We saw at our hospital that delays in activation (activating it as little as 10-15 later) were associated with an almost 3-fold increase in mortality. More recently, we have shown that every minute (every 60 seconds!) delay in activating your MTP after patient arrival is associated with a 5% increase likelihood of mortality, as is every minute delay in receiving the coolers once activated.</p>\n<p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the ABC Score? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest pitfall or inappropriate use is in settings where your ED/trauma team does not use FAST/ultrasound (or isn't very facile with FAST). In the initial development dataset and in subsequent validation datasets, the most powerful predictor of the four individual components was positive FAST. So, if you are going to use the ABC, you should be doing FAST on every patient (and doing them well).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a multi-center validation study, the ABC Score demonstrated a negative predictive value of over 95%, meaning that the score missed less than 5% of patients who ultimately received a massive transfusion. So, it will get products to the bedside when you need them (even though you may not end up using them all), but will only miss bringing the products to the bedside in a small number of cases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When looking at your program and seeing that not all patients predicted are getting to 10 units of RBCs shouldn't be viewed as a failure. The question is, is did they get/need multiple products in a short time frame after being predicted to need them? Also, if you are seeing true product waste (rather than blood bank tech time and MTP cooler \"runner\" time wastage), then one should look at your product handling and timely return of products. You should always be able to send products back in a timely fashion in patients that do not end up needing all or even some of the products.</p>\n<p><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you're particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p>We have recently shown that a prehospital ABC Score is just as powerful at predicting not only need for <g class=\"gr_ gr_50 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"50\" data-gr-id=\"50\">MTP,</g> but also emergency surgery. Our helicopter program uses the ABC Score to begin hanging whole blood, RBCs, and/or plasma in the prehospital setting and serves as <g class=\"gr_ gr_49 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"49\" data-gr-id=\"49\">an activation criteria</g> for our in-hospital MTP.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you use the ABC Score in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p>Not only have we used it as an entry <g class=\"gr_ gr_62 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"62\" data-gr-id=\"62\">criteria</g> for several randomized trials, <g class=\"gr_ gr_60 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace gr-progress\" id=\"60\" data-gr-id=\"60\">we</g> use it locally on a daily basis in both the prehospital and ED setting to activate our MTP. The recent data on time to activation, product delivery, and its effect on outcome has led us to place these products closer and closer to the patient. We now have not only RBCs and plasma on all our helicopters and in the trauma bay, but we have recently added whole blood to each of these areas to bring products quicker to the patient while we are waiting for delivery of the formal MTP coolers.</p>"
