They proposed the 4 step process for differentiating VT from SVT seen on EKGs with a wide QRS complex tachycardia. They validated their new approach by applying it to 554 wide QRS tachycardias and showed a sensitivity of 98.7% and specificity of 96.5%.</p>\n<p>A 1996 study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8572445\" target=\"_blank\">Herbert et al</a>, published in <em>Annals of Emergency Medicine, </em>demonstrated that emergency physicians disagreed 22% of the time when applying the Brugada Criteria.</p>\n<p>In 2000, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10917326\" target=\"_blank\">Isenhour et al</a> published a study in <em>Academic Emergency Medicine</em> to validate the Brugada algorithm. Sensitivity/specificity were 85%/60% and 91%/55% for two cardiologists, respectively, and 83%/43% and 79%/70% for two emergency physicians. The four were not able to reproduce the high sensitivity and specificity seen in the original study.</p>\n<p>In 2008, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180024\" target=\"_blank\">Vereckei et al</a> proposed a new diagnostic algorithm, restricting analysis to lead aVR and reported a superior accuracy to the Brugada Criteria (p = 0.002 vs p = 0.07). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3348347/\" target=\"_blank\">Baxi et al</a> attempted to validate this new criteria and reported that four emergency medicine residents had a diagnostic accuracy of 74%, 75%, 61% and 68%.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711501/\" target=\"_blank\">Garner and Miller</a> published an article in Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology Review compared diagnostic algorithms for WCTs and noted that the Brugada algorithm was one of the most accurate.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b1677377-df5c-af78-0bb2-6012c6384a73\">In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4040878/\" target=\"_blank\">Vereckei</a> wrote an article in Current Cardiology Review comparing several algorithms used for the diagnosis of WCTs and the Brugada algorithm was compared to the First Vereckei Algorithm, the aVR Vereckei Algorithm, and the Lead II R-wave Peak Time (RWPT) Criterion.</span></p>",
