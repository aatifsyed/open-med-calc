The five variables that make up the model were found to be significantly related to overall survival on multivariable analysis (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11773181\" target=\"_blank\">Motzer 2002</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple external validation studies were subsequently conducted on modified versions of the model either in the first-line setting (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15681528\" target=\"_blank\">Mekhail 2005</a>) or in the second-line setting in the pre-targeted therapy era (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3646307/\" target=\"_blank\">Motzer 2004</a>). Furthermore, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23312463\" target=\"_blank\">Heng et al (2013)</a> validated the original MSKCC Model and compared it to other similar models in the targeted therapy era. However, this study suggested that the <calculator id=\"3008\">IMDC Risk Model</calculator> has superior prognostic power over the MSKCC model. Although the two models were found to be highly concordant, the IMDC model showed better fit and reclassification accuracy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The MSKCC risk group is still among the most frequently used risk models for metastatic RCC, and is often reported along with the IMDC model in clinical trials.</p>",
