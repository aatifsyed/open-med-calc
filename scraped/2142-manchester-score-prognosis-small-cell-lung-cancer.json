Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">35 years ago, more prognostic information was asked by patients and treating physicians for, i.e., shared decision making, and since there is a small chance of cure in SCLC, any prognostically validated information could help to make the best treatment choice in individual cases.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you use the Manchester Score for Lung Cancer in your own clinical practice?
