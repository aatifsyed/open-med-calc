            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In patients with atrial fibrillation, stroke prevention is a part of the management plan. The <calculator id=\"40\">CHADS₂</calculator> or <calculator id=\"801\">CHA₂DS₂-Vasc Score</calculator> are often used to calculate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Stroke prevention comes in the form of aspirin or anticoagulation, depending on the risk of stroke. However, anticoagulation also creates bleeding risk. Prior existing risk calculators for risk of bleeding include <calculator id=\"807\">HAS-BLED</calculator>, <calculator id=\"1718\">ATRIA</calculator>, and others. Of these, HAS-BLED is probably the most used and well-validated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the above in mind, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/36/46/3258/2398371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O&rsquo;Brien et al (2015)</a> derived and validated the ORBIT Score as a way to assess bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Derivation was based on data from the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), a prospective registry of patients with atrial fibrillation across 176 sites in the United States. Of the 10,132 patients in the registry, 7,411 were analyzed (the rest were excluded for not being on oral anticoagulants or if follow-up data was lacking).&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Major bleeding was defined as fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical organ, or bleeding with hemoglobin drop requiring transfusion of &ge;2 units. The simplified 5-item ORBIT Score was based on the 5 predictors with the strongest association with major bleeding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The authors also validated the ORBIT Score with data from ROCKET-AF, a cohort of patients receiving rivaroxaban once-daily vs vitamin K antagonism. They showed that ORBIT showed better discrimination than ATRIA or HAS-BLED (c-index = 0.67, 0.66, 0.64, respectively).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, subsequent studies in different patient populations did not show ORBIT to be superior. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senoo et al (2016)</a> studied 2,293 patients in the AMADEUS trial and showed HAS-BLED to perform better in predicting major bleeding than the ORBIT score (c-index = 0.65 vs 0.61, p = 0.001). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27557850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Esteve-Pastor et al (2016)</a> showed ORBIT was not superior to HAS-BLED in predicting major bleeding in 406 patients undergoing electrocardioversion (c-index = 0.82 vs 0.77, p = 0.08), or in 1,276 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation in the FANTASIIA registry (c-index = 0.70 vs 0.63, p = 0.12). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang et al (2017)</a> conducted a meta-analysis showing that ORBIT was not superior to HAS-BLED in predicting major bleeding (8,079 total anticoagulated non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients from the United States, Britain, Spain, and the Netherlands).</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f362acac-7fff-d718-80db-65e27680e105\">Interestingly, the studies above also showed that ORBIT places more patients in the low-risk category than does HAS-BLED, thus potentially under-predicting their major bleeding risk (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senoo 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27557850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Esteve-Pastor 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wang 2017</a>). The concern with this is that some at-risk patients may not be flagged correctly. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lip et al (2018)</a> suggest that HAS-BLED has higher sensitivity but lower specificity for major bleeding risk when compared to the ORBIT Score. As a result, care must be taken when clinically applying the results of either score. </span></p>",
