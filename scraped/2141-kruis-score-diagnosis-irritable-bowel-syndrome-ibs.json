Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&rsquo;m retired, so I can only report my past use of the score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most important are the clinical questions. In patients suspicious of nonorganic complaints, I was always checking&mdash;for myself and during rounds with my young coworkers or during teaching rounds with students&mdash;does the history of the respective patients fit into the score?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the history fitted well, my aim was to prevent the patient from extensive diagnosis of exclusion (according to the score).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you develop the Kruis Score for IBS? Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a young clinical researcher, it was my task to collect patients with IBD. Soon I noticed that most patients with multiple symptoms don&rsquo;t have IBD, but rather non-organic disease. Looking for the literature, I was very much impressed by Manning&rsquo;s paper \"Towards positive diagnosis of the irritable bowel.&rdquo; But in intense discussions, it became clear that there is not only a positive diagnosis necessary but also a concise exclusion diagnosis. In reality, no one would fix a diagnosis exclusively on grounds of the history.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Kruis Score for IBS? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think the score is still valid (see also a review by R. Spiller). It should be re-evaluated again, focusing for exclusion on more modern procedures such as ultrasound or measurement of transglutaminase antibodies (to exclude celiac disease). As concerns the history, one could think about an additional history about preceding infectious disease as a cause of IBS.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you're particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-bae65848-7fff-9c4a-3b9f-a999001e9c55\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, microbiota (microbiome) in IBS as a tool to make a more specific diagnosis and to guide therapeutic concepts (I have just submitted original work).</p>"
