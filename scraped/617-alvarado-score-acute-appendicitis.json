In 305 patients aged 4-80 years, eight predictive factors were identified to stratify risk of acute appendicitis.

They found 35.6% sensitivity for appendicitis based on equivocal Alvarado scores (defined as 4-6) compared with 90.4% sensitivity of CT scan in this group, and concluded that patients with equivocal scores would benefit from CT.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29521805\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coleman et al (2018)</a> conducted a retrospective review in which the Alvarado Score was applied to a cohort of 492 patients (median age 33 years), and found that 20% of patients were in either the high risk group (defined as &ge;9 in males and &ge;10 in females) or the low risk group (males &le;1, females &le;2), and cumulatively spent over 170 hours awaiting CT that was ultimately unnecessary. They found that scores of 0 or 1 had 0% incidence of acute appendicitis, &nbsp;and that 100% of males with scores 9-10 and 100% of females with score 10 had acute appendicitis confirmed on surgical pathology.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a6d5b566-7fff-4a6e-1e68-d8d94110ae86\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25706925\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pogorelić et al (2015)</a> prospectively studied 311 pediatric patients and applied both the Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12037754\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samuel 2002</a>).
