The objective of the authors was to design a clinical tool that was able to predict streptococcal infection, thereby reducing the need for both rapid antigen detection tests and potentially unnecessary antibiotics. In the study, three groups were compared: a control group in which patients received a delayed antibiotic prescription (to fill in 3-5 days if no symptom relief), a clinical score group, and a rapid antigen detection test (RAT) group.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the clinical score group, antibiotics were not offered to those with scores of 0/1, delayed antibiotics were offered for those with scores of 2/3 and immediate antibiotics were offered to those with scores of 4 or higher. Diagnostic studies in this group showed that 63% of those with scores of 4 or higher had a streptococcal infection. Lastly, in the RAT group, those with low scores of 0/1 were not offered a RAT, those with a score of 2 were offered a delayed prescription, and those with a score of 3 or more underwent a RAT on premises. Of that group, 55% had a streptococcal infection.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The authors concluded that the use of RAT according to a clinical score provided no clear advantage over a clinical score alone. Additionally, the authors looked at symptom relief and found that the use of a clinical score was shown to improve symptoms and reduce antibiotic usage in affected patients.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-355cf919-7fff-f978-746d-aa28e444d635\">A randomized controlled trial looking at the FeverPAIN Score was done by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little et al in 2014</a>. The authors found that use of the FeverPAIN score resulted in a reduction in symptom severity as well as a reduction in antibiotic usage as compared to a delayed treatment group. Moderate or worse symptom severity was also reduced as compared to a RAT group, however antibiotic usage was similar between the FeverPAIN group and the RAT group. The authors concluded that using a clinical score to target antibiotic use will both improve symptoms and reduce overall antibiotic use.</span></p>",
