(<a href='http://www.pubmed.gov/15635308/' target='_blank'>Gill 2005</a>)</li> <li>A secondary analysis of 21,170 patients from a large prospective trauma database found that the SMS also performed comparably to the total GCS with respect to the same 4 key outcome measures (need for ED intubation, neurosurgical intervention, traumatic brain injury and mortality) with a median difference of 5%. (<a href='http://www.pubmed.gov/17113193/' target='_blank'>Haukoos 2006</a>)</li> <li>A similar analysis of 19,408 patients in the out-of-hospital setting found the SMS had nearly equivalent discriminatory ability (small statistical differences, but no clinically significant [a priori defined as &lt;5% absolute difference in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve]) compared to the GCS. (<a href='http://www.pubmed.gov/21803448/' target='_blank'>Thompson 2011</a>)</li> <li>A large retrospective analysis of a statewide trauma registry of 52,412 again found the SMS had comparable sensitivity compared to the GCS for mortality (72.2% vs. 74.6%), traumatic brain injury (40.8 vs 45.4%), need for neurosurgery (52.9% vs. 60%) and intubation (72.7% vs. 75.5%) and conclude the performance of the two score to be “clinically indistinguishable.” (<a href='http://www.pubmed.gov/21795294/' target='_blank'>Caterino 2011</a>)</li> <li>According a large meta-analysis the SMS was 86-88% sensitive for predicting mortality vs. the GCS which was 90-91% sensitive. Given the large sample size this difference was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.01), though the authors found “the difference to be very small and the clinical significance remained undetermined.” (<a href='http://www.pubmed.gov/23252405/' target='blank'>Singh 2012</a>)</li> </ul>",
