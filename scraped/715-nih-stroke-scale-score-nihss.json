This was intended for use in an NIH-sponsored trial of naloxone for stroke (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2749846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brott 1989</a>).</li>\n<li>Brott&rsquo;s Cincinnati/Naloxone stroke scale was modified by Lyden and colleagues (1994) for use in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) study on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients with ischemic stroke (<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199512143332401\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NINDS 1995</a>).</li>\n<li>A retrospective review of 1281 subjects with ischemic stroke found that for every 1 point increase in the NIHSS decreased the likelihood of an excellent outcome by 24% at 7 days and 17% at 3 months (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10408548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Adams 1999</a>).</li>\n<li>In a trial of 94 patients, authors found that &nbsp;each 1 point increase in the NIHSS when performed within 24 hours of the stroke correlated with a decreased likelihood of the patient being discharged (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511764\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schlegel 2003</a>).</li>\n<li>A study of 893 patients found that their initial NIHSS score (performed within 72 hours of the ischemic event) was predictive of whether the patient would need to be placed in a nursing home or need to be sent to rehabilitation. &nbsp;Patients with moderate (6-13 points) or severe (&gt;14 points) NIHSS scores were 3 times more likely to be placed in a nursing home after discharge and 8 more times likely to require rehabilitation therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rundek 2000</a>).</li>\n<li>A study of 377 patients found that when performed 24-48 hours after an ischemic stroke, that the NIHSS was broadly predictive of group outcomes at 1-year, with 75% of patients who had a score of 4 or less being functionally independent (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14530634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Appelros 2004</a>).</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Median score in this study was 6, with 33% of patients dying within the first year after their event.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>A prospective trial of 54 patients found that combining diffusion weighted MRI imaging with the NIHSS score was more predictive of clinical outcomes at 3 months (70%) than with using the score (43%) or imaging (54%) alone (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20595665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yoo 2010</a>).</li>\n<li>In an analysis of 312 subjects from the NINDS trials, authors found that an NIHSS of &gt;20 was associated with a 17% rate of intracranial hemorrhage with tPA vs. a 3% hemorrhage rate in patients with a score of &lt;10 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9368550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group 1997</a>).</li>\n</ul>",

Are there cases in which it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong><br>The point of the NIHSS is to rate groups of patients, not individuals. This is fundamental and important for users to keep in mind. A lot of the scoring rules are counterintuitive if you’re a good neurologist. It’s not true that you have to be a neurologist in order to use the NIHSS. You have to use the scoring rules. Neurologists actually do the worst. ED physicians do the best, because they follow the rules. Neurologists think they’re smarter than the scale, so they don’t follow the scoring rules. The scoring rules are there to assure reproducibility, across users of all different backgrounds, whether it’s a neuro nurse, a neurologist, or an ED physician. </p> <p>The government is now looking at outcomes based on stroke severity, so all of a sudden, this scale that we invented for research has become essential for hospitals to get reimbursed, because the more severe the stroke is, the more the reimbursement. The stroke scale has grown so far beyond its original purpose, which is fine, but you have to understand where it came from and how to use it correctly.</p> <p><strong>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the NIH stroke scale?<br></strong>Higher stroke scale scores indicate higher severity and poorer prognosis, but the stroke scale is NOT a guide to picking patients for tPA. tPA should be used regardless of severity. </p> <p><strong>How does the NIHSS compare to other stroke assessments?<br></strong>At the time the NIHSS was developed, there were a dozen other scales, and they’re all roughly the same. There’s only so many ways to put numbers on the neuro exam. But the NIHSS is the most widely used, because of its use in the tPA trial, and there are training videos available. It was adopted because it happened to be the scale that was used in the tPA trial. And since the tPA trial was the first positive stroke<em> [treatment]</em> study, everybody started using the NIHSS. So there are over 800,000 people worldwide who have been certified with those videos. It’s not inherently better than any other scale, but it’s used, and everybody knows it.</p> <p><strong>Why did you modify the original NIHSS?<br></strong>The modified NIHSS is more reproducible than the original. We collapsed some items, and made some items easier to score, and the data show that it’s clearly more reproducible than the original. But it has not really been adopted. </p> <p><strong>Why not?<br></strong>I think it’s just inertia. I think if people got familiar with the modified NIHSS, they would use it, but it was never part of a successful clinical trial, so it didn’t have the cachet of the original scale. </p>"
