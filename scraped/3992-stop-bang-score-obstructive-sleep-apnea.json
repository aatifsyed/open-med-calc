The focus of this seminal paper is on the STOP questions in preoperative patients. However, appendix two is the STOP-BANG questionnaire which includes four objective assessments alongside of the four STOP questions. By including the BANG assessments with the STOP questions, the authors increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value of the screening test. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>STOP-BANG has been studied and validated in multiple settings:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323734\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xar&aacute; 2015</a>: High-risk OSA patients (&gt;3 on STOP-BANG) have a greater incidence of postoperative respiratory complications including inability to breathe deeply and episodes of desaturation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uch&ocirc;a 2015</a>: OSA is independently associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular events following coronary bypass graft surgery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tan 2016</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nagappa 2015</a>: While initially developed for preoperative patients, STOP-BANG is an effective screen for the general population.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been translated to and validated in multiple languages including <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25758298\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arabic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Portuguese</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25182345\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chinese</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26621392\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Danish</a>.</p>",
