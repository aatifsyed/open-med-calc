As described in detail above, the scale consists of an 11-item rating system that can be completed within two minutes by a trained observer and can track opioid withdrawal as differentiated from opioid toxicity through serial measurements. It was designed to be administered quickly and was intended to improve upon existing measurement tools.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2774236/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Validation study</a></strong></p>\n<p>This study validated the COWS in comparison to the validated Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA) scale. It used a double-blind randomized design to compare opioid withdrawal symptoms for intramuscularly administered placebo vs. naloxone to 46 opioid-dependent participants. COWS and CINA scores during the naloxone challenge session were well correlated with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (p&lt;0.001) while placebo was not associated with any significant elevation in either score. Additional evidence of concurrent validity was provided by comparing COWS with the self-reporting visual analog scale (VAS); COWS scores correlated well with peak VAS scores of bad drug effect (r=0.57, p&lt;0.001) and feeling sick (r=0.57, p&lt;0.001). Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha for the COWS was 0.78, indicating good internal consistency (reliability).</p>",
