            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The OHFRS was derived from a prospective cohort study at six large Canadian EDs by <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.12056/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Stiell et al (2013)</a>. A total of 559 patient visits were evaluated to determine the rates of admission and serious adverse events (SAE, defined as death, MI, or need for ICU or intubation). Variables from history, physical exam, imaging, ECG, and laboratory studies were assessed with univariate analysis. Statistically significant variables associated with SAE were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to determine independent predictors for SAE.</p> <p>Using the predictors identified, the performance of the score was validated in the study population for sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio across 1,000 replications using the bootstrap method. 52% of patients admitted from their first ER visit had documented SAE. Using OHFRS values of 1, 2, or 3 as a threshold for admission had higher sensitivity for identifying and admitting patients who had an SAE within 14 days of initial encounter (95.2, 80.6, and 64.5%, respectively). &nbsp;</p> <p>The OHFRS was prospectively validated by <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acem.13141/full\" target=\"_blank\">Stiell et al (2017)</a> in an observational cohort study including 1,100 patients who were enrolled and followed for occurrence of an SAE within 30 days of initial presentation. Similar inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for the validation study as the primary study. They found that an admission threshold of OHFRS &gt;1 improved sensitivity compared to previous practice. OHFRS &gt;2 had equivocal sensitivity for SAE as previous practice, but reduced admission rates substantially. &nbsp;</p> <p>The study authors also compared sensitivity with and without the use of NT-proBNP and found results to be similar in improved sensitivity compared to previous practice. &nbsp;The use of NT-proBNP in the score improved sensitivity of the OHFRS compared to omitting the laboratory study from the score.</p>",
