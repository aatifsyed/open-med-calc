When compared to gold standards of CT scan, diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), and/or operative findings, FAST had a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 96%. FAST was further validated in 1998 in a much larger <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1191535/\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> (<em>n</em> = 1,540) by the same group. This showed that FAST is most sensitive and specific in patients with penetrating precordial wounds (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%) and in hypotensive patients after blunt abdominal trauma (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). They concluded that the accuracy of FAST in these clinical scenarios justified surgical intervention on the basis of the FAST findings in these trauma patients. With the application of FAST outside of study protocols by non-experts and non-radiologists, the contemporary diagnostic yield of FAST ranges more broadly. Recent studies quote a sensitivity of 22–98% for FAST in the detection of hemoperitoneum (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318439\" target=\"_blank\">Richards 2017</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25498329\" target=\"_blank\">Carter 2015</a>).</p> <p>More recently, thoracic views have been added to the FAST exam and termed eFAST. These windows assess the chest bilaterally for pneumo- and hemothoraces. In some series, the reported sensitivities of eFAST (86–100%) are superior to that of chest x-ray (27–83%) in the detection of pneumothoraces (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26649350\" target=\"_blank\">Governatori 2015</a>,<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20149371\" target=\"_blank\"> Nandipati 2011</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20078434\" target=\"_blank\">Wilkerson 2010</a>).</p>",

However, FAST can be a helpful adjunct in clinical decision making, particularly in an unstable blunt trauma patient in order to rapidly assess the chest and abdomen for potential causes of hypotension.</li> <li>Most clinicians use the low frequency phased array ultrasound probe (a.k.a. cardiac probe), to obtain all windows in FAST. </li> <li><strong>Pericardial:</strong> place probe in the subxiphoid area and orient towards patient's left shoulder. Apply downward pressure to look under the costal margin and towards the heart. The heart and pericardium will come into view, allowing inspection for hemopericardium and ultrasound findings of cardiac tamponade.</li> <li><strong>Right upper quadrant:</strong> place probe in right anterior to mid axillary line (between 11th–12th ribs).

It can be helpful to bring the probe all the way down to the stretcher in order to best visualize these windows.</li> <li><strong>Suprapubic:</strong> place transducer superior to pubic symphysis and fan probe inferiorly to visualize the bladder.</li> </ul>",
            "critical_actions_en": "<ul> <li>Repeating FAST while preparing to perform diagnostic peritoneal aspiration is useful to quickly reassess unstable patients with blunt abdominal trauma with initially negative FAST. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage may not be significant enough on presentation to be FAST-positive initially.</li> <li>Be cautious if pericardial FAST is negative in patients with penetrating thoracic trauma, especially if unstable. Cardiac injuries can decompress through the injured pericardium, most commonly into the left hemithorax, resulting in negative pericardial FAST (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901678\" target=\"_blank\">Ball 2009</a>). Therefore, unstable patients with this mechanism of injury and FAST finding should undergo a chest x-ray. If it reveals a hemothorax, a chest tube must be placed.
