The goal was to compare ability of T-MACS to the original MACS, the latter of which included both hs-cTnT and H-FABP (heart-type fatty acid binding protein) in predicting ACS or MACE.</p>\n<p><strong>Patient Cohorts:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derived from 703 ED patients from Manchester Royal Infirmary.</li>\n<li>Validated in set of 3 cohorts: 462 from Stepping Hill Hospital, 191 from Manchester Royal Infirmary, and 806 from Poole NHS Foundation Trust.</li>\n<li>Included ED patients complaining of chest pain who the clinician suspected as possibly having cardiac chest pain.</li>\n<li>Caveat: Unlike patients in the other 2 validation cohorts, patients from Poole that had EKG findings of ischemia were excluded from the study.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Follow-up: </strong></p>\n<p>Standard troponin test &gt;12 hours after peak symptoms or least 6 hours after ED presentation. Patients (or their primary care physician) were also contacted after 30 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes: </strong></p>\n<p>The primary outcome was diagnosis of ACS or MACE (AMI, death, coronary revascularization) in 30 days, with a secondary outcome of &gt;50% coronary stenosis, even if no intervention was undertaken.</p>\n<p><strong>Results in the derivation set:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>22.3% had ACS (18.5% with AMI).</li>\n<li>37.7% were labeled as very low risk for ACS (<abbr title=\"Negative Predictive Value\">NPV</abbr> 99.3%).</li>\n<li>Two patients labeled as very low risk had ACS.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>#1: hs-cTnT of 9 ng/L and non-ischemic EKG within 1 hour of symptom onset but cTnT of 2650 ng/L at 12 hours.</li>\n<li>#2: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 30 days despite normal cTnT levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>10.1% were labeled as high risk for ACS (<abbr title=\"Positive Predictive Value\">PPV</abbr> 100%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Results in the validation set:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>14.5% had ACS (11.8% with AMI).</li>\n<li>40.4% were labeled as very low risk for ACS (NPV 99.3%).</li>\n<li>Four patients labeled as very low risk had ACS.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>#1: hs-cTnT 6 ng/L on arrival, 43 ng/L at hour 6; &nbsp;paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.</li>\n<li>#2: hs-cTnT 6 ng/L on arrival, 18 ng/L at hour 6; moderate <abbr title=\"Left Anterior Descending\">LAD</abbr> stenosis on CT coronary angiography but no intervention.</li>\n<li>#3: Ischemic chest pain, PCI on day 4.</li>\n<li>#4: Ischemic chest pain, PCI on day 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Seven patients (1.2%) labeled as very low risk had stenosis found on angiography but did not have intervention.</li>\n<li>4.7% were labeled as high risk for ACS (PPV 84%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Comparing T-MACS to MACS:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compared to its predecessor, MACS (which incorporated both hs-cTnT and H-FABP), T-MACS uses a lower hs-cTnT threshold without greatly sacrificing sensitivity.</li>\n<li>MACS with 18.0% labeled as very low risk vs. T-MACS 40.5%.</li>\n<li>Sensitivity for MACS was 100% vs. T-MACS 98.4% (<em>p</em>=0.25).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>~40% can be labeled as very low risk with &lt;1% probability of ACS.</li>\n<li>~5% can be labeled as high risk of ACS.</li>\n</ul>",
