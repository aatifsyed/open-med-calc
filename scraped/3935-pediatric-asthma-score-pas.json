Outcomes and costs of treatment of asthmatic children before and after implementation of the PAS and associated treatment guidelines were examined in a retrospective cohort. &nbsp;</p> <p>149 children were treated according to the clinical pathway from Sept to Dec 1997. &nbsp;Thirty-four were randomly selected and matched based on demographics (age, race, gender, admission, time of year, and comorbidities) to a cohort control group of asthmatic children treated prior to the implementation of the PAS and treatment protocol. &nbsp;</p> <p>When comparing the two groups, they found:</p> <ul> <li>Length of stay was approximately 50% lower in the group that used the PAS and treatment pathway.</li> <li>Cost was on average $1,200 lower in the group that used the PAS and pathway.</li> <li>Children in the PAS and pathway group were more likely to receive asthma education, prescriptions for controller medications, and equipment (spacers and peak flow meters) prior to discharge</li> <li>PAS patients were more likely to receive oral corticosteroids over IV corticosteroids.</li> <li>PAS patients were more likely to have close follow-up arranged at discharge than control patients.</li> </ul> <p>While the results were profound and statistically significant, it is important to note that the sample size in this study was small. &nbsp;Additionally, although the control and cohort groups had similar demographics, they may not reflect the general population of pediatric asthmatics. For example, the two groups compared in the study were both 76% male, 97% African-American, and mostly between the ages of 2 and 15.</p> <p>In&nbsp;a review article on severe acute asthma exacerbations, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3668947/\" target=\"_blank\">Neivas and Anand</a> cite the PAS as a reliable means of assessing asthma severity in the ICU setting.</p>",
