This paper was not not published outside of the proceedings of the meeting; thus, in this 1984 paper, Ewing describes how the CAGE questions were identified and their subsequent use in clinical and research studies. They assert that since its introduction, CAGE has been recognized as one of the most efficient and effective screening devices for alcoholism.</p><p><a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6120322' target='_blank'><b>Validation</b></a></p><p>In this article, a comparison is made between the efficacy of eight laboratory tests and three rapid interviews (CAGE, Brief MAST, Reich) in the detection of excessive drinking and alcoholism among 385 psychiatric patients. gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. They found that CAGE was effective in identifying 9 out of 10 alcoholics and 93% of excessive drinkers, compared with the laboratory tests detecting only 33% in these populations.  Authors conclude that due to ease of administration (taking &lt;1 minute), the interview forms have considerable potential for routine screening of high-risk groups such as hospital patients.</p>",
