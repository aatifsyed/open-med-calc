In 1994, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8065869\" target=\"_blank\">Jaskiewicz et al</a> validated the criteria by aggregating data from three prospective studies conducted from 1984-1992. Only infants ≤60 days with rectal temperature ≥38ºC at home or at presentation were included. Clinical environment included an emergency department and a pediatric outpatient clinic. </p> <p>Evaluation of each infant included global assessment, past medical history, physical examination (no evidence of skin, soft tissue, bone, or joint infection), and laboratory assessment including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. Chest x-ray and stool studies were only obtained if clinical symptoms were present. Of note, CSF studies were NOT a part of the Rochester risk-stratification criteria. </p> <p>Each infant was then stratified as low-risk or not low risk. Of 931 evaluable, 437 met all of the low-risk criteria, and 511 did not. The study’s main outcomes were bacteremia and a larger, inclusive category: serious bacterial infection (SBI). SBI included: bacteremia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, suppurative arthritis, soft tissue infections (cellulitis, abscess, mastitis, omphalitis), urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia. </p> <p>SBI was identified in 1% of low risk infants as compared to 12.3% of non-low risk infants. The negative predictive value of the low-risk criteria was 99.5% for bacteremia and 98.9% for SBI.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24422856\" target=\"_blank\">Hui et al</a> conducted a review of 84 studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for SBI and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in infants less than 3 months. This review also examined the relationship between viral testing and risk of SBI. </p> <p>The combined clinical and laboratory criteria (Rochester, Philadelphia, Boston, and Milwaukee) demonstrated similar overall accuracy (sensitivity: 84.4-100%; negative predictive value: 93.7-100%) for identifying infants with SBI. The Rochester criteria were more accurate in neonates than in older infants; the other screening tools were more accurate in older infants as opposed to neonates. </p> <p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27382134\" target=\"_blank\">Gomez et al</a> conducted a prospective study including infants &lt;90 days presenting to 11 European pediatric emergency departments between September 2012 and August 2014. They compared the accuracies of the new Step-by-Step approach, Rochester Criteria, and Lab-score in identifying those patients at low risk of invasive bacterial infection (IBI). </p> <p>For their study population, the sensitivity (“sens”) and negative predictive value (NPV) for ruling out IBI were as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Step-by-Step: sens 92.0%, NPV 99.3%.</li> <li>Rochester: sens 81.6%, NPV 98.3%.</li> <li>Lab-score: sens 59.8, NPV 98.1%.</li> </ul> <p>Seven infants with an IBI were misclassified by the Step by Step, 16 by Rochester criteria, and 35 by the Lab-score.</p>",

Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p> <p>Prior to the development of the Rochester Criteria, the consensus was that there was no way to predict which child under 3 months of age will have serious bacterial infection (SBI). Too many children that obviously did not have much risk to have SBI were hospitalized, submitted to sepsis workup, and treated with antibiotics for 2-3 days at least. My thought was that instead of looking for who has SBI, we needed to look at those who are very likely NOT to have SBI.</p> <p>I have used my clinical experience from my residency in Israel to set a list of criteria that would suggest no SBI and tested them first in Rochester (during my fellowship) and then submitted them for validation later in Israel. These criteria were proved to be able to rule out more than 2/3 of the \"suspected\" children under 3 months of age, and thus only ~1/3 needed to be subjected to sepsis workup.</p> <p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Rochester Criteria? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p> <ol> <li>Remember that part of these criteria is the absence of previous history that suggests SBI (previously healthy!).</li> <li>Remember that any real sick looking baby (i.e., toxic) should be treated anyhow.</li> <li>Remember that very low risk is still not 100% proof! The group of neonates under 2-3 weeks was the minority in these studies, so be even more careful with this group before you decide they are low risk.</li> <li>Remember to follow all those who are not treated very carefully!</li> </ol> <p><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the Rochester Criteria? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p> <p>Just remember that infants &lt;2-3 months may show a dynamic disease, so follow up very carefully.</p> <p><strong>How do you use the Rochester Criteria in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p> <p>In our pediatric emergency room at the Soroka University Medical Center in Beer-Sheva, Israel, the Rochester criteria are the gold standard guidelines for suspected sepsis or febrile children &lt;2-3 months. However, we always warn that in doubt, treat. Low risk infants can be sent home if there is no other reason for hospitalization (e.g. dehydration, hypoxemia).</p>"
