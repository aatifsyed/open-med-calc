Claassen and colleagues from Columbia University Medical Center, who first showed that thick cisternal subarachnoid hemorrhage and IVH in 2 lateral ventricles were both independently associated with DCI in a retrospective multivariate analysis of 276 patients with aSAH. They proposed a scale whose grades accounted for thickness of subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral lateral ventricular IVH in 4 different combinations (risks for each grade not shown here).
