The overall response rate of deferred treatment was 70%, with prednimustine was 78%, and with interferon-alpha was 70%. Similarly, the overall survival time at 5 years was 78%, 70%, and 84%, respectively. This showed that delayed treatment was a viable option for such an indolent lymphoma. However, those with early progression warrant treatment sooner.</p>",
