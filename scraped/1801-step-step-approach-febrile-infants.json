Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We decided to design this tool because we commonly used different biomarkers that were not adequately included in existing protocols, and we wanted to get a good tool to identify young febrile infants suitable for outpatient management.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Step by Step Approach to Febrile Infants? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have to clarify better the following:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. What to to do with the intermediate group after observation in the ED.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. The role of the ED observation in the low risk group. To identify infants that do not need to be observed in the ED.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. We have the feedback form other hospitals using the \"Step by Step\" (abstracts in national meetings) without incidences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the Step by Step Approach to Febrile Infants? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have to remind them of the importance of the infant&rsquo;s appearance - the first \"box\" of the algorithm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you use the Step by Step Approach to Febrile Infants in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong><br />We use it in all young febrile infants.
