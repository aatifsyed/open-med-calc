(2020)</a>, a retrospective analysis of 269 patients &ge;18 years old diagnosed with TBI from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 admitted to UCHealth Memorial Hospital Central (Colorado Springs, CO), Loyola University Medical Center (Maywood, Illinois), Medical Center of the Rockies (Loveland, CO) was performed. They were identified by trauma registry or electronic medical record. All patients &ge;18 years old from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 with findings of an ICH or skull fracture on initial head CT scan and no abnormalities on neurologic examination were included in the study.</p>\n<p>Exclusion criteria were the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients meeting BIG 3 criteria.</li>\n<li>Patients with penetrating injuries.</li>\n<li>Patients who presented greater than 48&thinsp;hours&nbsp;after injury.</li>\n<li>Patients transferred from outside hospitals without available images from initial CT.</li>\n<li>Patients with previous brain operations.</li>\n<li>Patients intubation within the first 6&thinsp;hours of presentation.</li>\n<li>Patients in which withdrawal of care or comfort measures were initiated within the first 48&thinsp;hours of presentation.</li>\n<li>Patients with missing values.</li>\n<li>Patients who did not receive a repeat head CT.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32537518/\">Khan et al.</a> demonstrated that the BIG criteria was accurate in identifying low-risk TBI patients at the three institutions. Multivariable logistic regression identified EDH (p = 0.033) and IPH (p = 0.026) as independent predictors of progression/worsening of injury.</p>\n<p>The strengths of this study included the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multicenter study.</li>\n<li>mBIG criteria identified all low risk patients.</li>\n<li>Application of criteria could result in substantial savings cost and resource utilization in the treatment of TBI patients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were a few areas of improvement noted by the authors such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Study was a retrospective, database study, reliant on correct coding and subject to variability in patient management across providers and institutions.</li>\n<li>Not prospectively validated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35358157/\">Khan et al. (2022)</a> was a multicenter review of prospectively collected data with historical control. The study consisted of 764 patients total at 3 trauma centers, 496 in the post mBIG implementation cohort and 268 from a historical cohort. It included patients who were older than 15 years old with an ICH or skull fracture on CT scan. Exclusion criteria included patients with an mBIG 3 classification, intubation, previous operation on the brain or skull, penetrating injury, transfers from outside hospitals without available images, patients who presented&nbsp;more than 48 hours from injury.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35358157/\">Khan et al. (2022)</a> found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fewer computed tomography scans (2 [1,2] vs. 2 [2,3], p &lt; 0.0001) and neurosurgery consults (61.9% vs. 95.9%, p &lt; 0.0001) were obtained post-mBIG implementation vs pre-BIG cohort.</li>\n<li>Hospital (2 [1,4] vs. 2 [2,4], p = 0.013) and intensive care unit (0 [0,1] vs. 1 [1,2], p &lt; 0.0001) length of stay were shorter after mBIG implementation.</li>\n<li>No statistical difference seen between groups in rate of clinical (1.6% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.172), radiographic progression (13.2% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.650), neurosurgery operative intervention (0.2% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.127), or mortality (0.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.999).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No difference was seen in the rate of clinical or radiographic progression, neurosurgery operations, or mortality between the two groups. The strength of this study was its multicenter nature.</p>\n<p>Areas for improvement in future work include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combined prospective and retrospective cohort with use of historical controls.</li>\n<li>As a multicenter trial, differences in practice patterns between the institutions may confound findings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28590352/\">Azim et al. (2017)</a> was a prospective cohort study with historical control to evaluate use of the mBIG criteria for the management of pediatric TBI patients with ICH without neurosurgical consult (NC). Subanalysis based on patient age showed a decrease in the use of repeat head CT (p = 0.02) in the no-NC group, with no difference in progression (p = 0.34) and the need for neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.9) compared with the NC group. Authors concluded that mBIG can be safely implemented in pediatric TBI patients.</p>",
