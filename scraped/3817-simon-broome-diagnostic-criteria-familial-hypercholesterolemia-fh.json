The diagnostic criteria were developed and validated in a prospective cohort study of 526 patients with confirmed heterozygous FH (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1671226/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Broome Register Group 1991</a>).</p> <p>The study’s objective was to examine mortality in patients with FH. Patients were age 20-74 years at the time of registration and had biochemically confirmed heterozygous FH.</p> <p>The investigators found that by using the selected criteria, age-specific cardiac-related mortality in younger FH patients (age 20-39 years) was increased 100-fold compared to the general population, with overall mortality increased 10-fold.</p> <p>Similar findings were reported in a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9920511\" target=\"_blank\">subsequent study in 1999</a> by the same group. They also found that initiating lipid-lowering therapy improved cardiac-related mortality, but non-cardiac mortality was not increased at any age (RR for all ages 0.68, 0.45-0.99).</p>",
