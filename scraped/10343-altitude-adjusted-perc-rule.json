The PERC Rule was validated by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18272098/\">Wolf et al in a 2008 study</a> performed in Denver, CO (at 5280 feet elevation). They used an oxygen saturation cut off of 90% to account for the higher elevation. Their study was relatively small and included 134 patients, 12% of whom were diagnosed with PE. Of the patients with a low pretest probability, 22% were PERC-Altitude negative, and none of them were diagnosed with a PE. The sensitivity of the PERC-Altitude Rule for the total cohort was 100%, but due to the small sample size, it has wide confidence intervals (79-100).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-25582f8d-7fff-d795-1ba9-5c95d7bc801e\">In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(18)30429-7/fulltext\">Madsen et al</a> published a much larger, prospective, observational study of patients from Salt Lake City, UT (elevation of 4980 feet) using the same 90% oxygen saturation cutoff. They enrolled 3,024 patients who presented with chest pain and/or dyspnea. There were 58 patients diagnosed with acute PE. Using the 95% oxygen saturation cutoff from the original PERC rule (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304025\">Kline 2004</a>), the sensitivity was 96.6%. There were two patients who were PERC negative who were diagnosed with acute PE. When they used the altitude-adjusted PERC rule, 4.3% of PERC-positive patients were reclassified as PERC negative. One of the patients who was reclassified as PERC negative had an acute PE, so the sensitivity for the altitude-adjusted PERC rule was slightly less at 94.8%. They estimated that using the altitude-adjusted PERC reduced the number of CTPA scans by 2.7% compared to using the original PERC. </p>",
