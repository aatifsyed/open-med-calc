The presence of an anti-D leads to a potential risk for HDFN in future pregnancies. Therefore, to prevent HDFN and the formation of an anti-D in the mother, RhIG is given to the mother at 28 weeks and after birth. The amount of RhIG given to the mother after birth is dependent on the amount of fetal-maternal hemorrhage. This formula calculates the amount of fetal-maternal hemorrhage as well as the number of RhIG vials be given to the mother.</p>"
