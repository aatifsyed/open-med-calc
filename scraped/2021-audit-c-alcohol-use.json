It was first published as a manual in 1989, and most recently updated in 2001. The AUDIT-C was developed in 1998 due to the recognition that the 10-question length of the AUDIT made it unlikely that primary providers would incorporate it into routine patient interviews or general health history questionnaires. In studying a VA primary care setting, they found that although the full AUDIT performed better than AUDIT-C for detecting active alcohol abuse or dependence (0.811 vs 0.786;P<.001), the 2 questionnaires performed similarly for detecting heavy drinking and/or active abuse or dependence (0.880 vs 0.881). This validated the AUDIT-C for use in detecting heavy drinking and active abuse/dependence.</p> <p><strong>Validation article</strong> (<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17451397' target='_blank'>Bradley 2007</a>):</p> <p>This was a cross-sectional validation study that compared several types of alcohol screening questionnaires with standardized interviews in a primary care setting. The AUDIT-C, full AUDIT, self-reported risky drinking, AUDIT question #3, and an augmented CAGE questionnaire were compared with an interview primary reference standard of alcohol misuse, defined as a DSM, 4th ed. alcohol use disorder and/or drinking above recommended limits in the past year. The results indicated that AUDIT-C was an effective screening test for alcohol misuse in this primary care sample, with optimal screening thresholds for alcohol misuse among men (≥4) and women (≥3).</p> <p><strong>Validation article</strong> (<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517893/' target='_blank'>Frank 2008</a>)</a>:</p> <p>The first validation article utilized primarily a CaucasianWhite population. This article evaluated the validity of the AUDIT-C among primary care patients from an expanded group of racial subgroups including CaucasiansWhites, African Americans, and Hispanics. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AuROCs) evaluated overall AUDIT-C performance in the 3 racial/ethnic groups compared to diagnostic interviews for alcohol misuse. The overall performance of the AUDIT-C was excellent in all 3 racial/ethnic groups as reflected by high AuROCs.</p>",
