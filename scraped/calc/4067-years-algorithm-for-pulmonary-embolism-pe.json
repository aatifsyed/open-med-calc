            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>Original YEARS study:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prospective cohort study conducted in 12 hospitals across the Netherlands in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.</li>\n<li>The algorithm was applied by first evaluating the presence of YEARS items: clinical signs of DVT, hemoptysis, or PE most likely diagnosis. All patients underwent a D-dimer test. In patients with no YEARS items and D-dimer &lt;1,000 ng/mL, PE was excluded and no CTPA was performed. In patients with one or more YEARS items and D-dimer &lt;500 ng/mL, PE was excluded and no CTPA was performed. All other patients received CTPA.</li>\n<li>Primary outcome was number of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events during the 3 months after PE was excluded and was analyzed using per protocol approach. The secondary outcome was the number of required CTPA compared to Wells&rsquo; Score for PE, analyzed using an intention-to-treat analysis.</li>\n<li>3,616 patients with clinically suspected PE were screened, and 3,465 were included in the study.</li>\n<li>18 (0.61%) were diagnosed with a symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the 3 month follow up. 6 of those patients had fatal PE (0.21%). &nbsp;</li>\n<li>2,946 patients (85%) were ruled out for PE using the algorithm. Of 1,629 patients who were ruled out without CTPA, 7 (0.43%) had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during the 3 month follow up, 2 of which were fatal.</li>\n<li>1,317 (15%) of patients were managed with CTPA. Of those patients, 11 (0.84%) had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3 month follow up, 4 of which were fatal.</li>\n<li>When compared to Wells&rsquo; Score with fixed D-dimer of 500 ng/mL, the YEARS algorithm reduced CTPA by 14% across all ages and subgroups.</li>\n<li>It appears as though the binary D-dimer cutoffs used in the YEARS trial reduced the rate of CTPA when compared to using age adjusted D-dimer.</li>\n<li>If age adjusted D-dimer was applied, the YEARS algorithm would have led to an absolute reduction of CTPA by only 8.7% compared to 14% using the binary cutoffs of the YEARS algorithm.</li>\n<li>Age adjusted D-dimer, defined as age x 10 in patients over the age of 50, has been prospectively validated to be safe and reduce the number of CTPA in patients low risk for PE.</li>\n<li>Take note of the following exclusion criteria:\n<ul>\n<li>Treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants initiated 24 hours or more before eligibility assessment.</li>\n<li>Life expectancy less than 3 months.</li>\n<li>Geographic inaccessibility precluding follow-up.</li>\n<li>Pregnancy (be sure to use pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm in the calc).</li>\n<li>Allergy to intravenous contrast agent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Subgroup analysis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The authors of the original YEARS study published a subgroup analysis of the patients 50 years and older and compared this subgroup to the age adjusted d-dimer cutoffs.</li>\n<li>In the YEARS study, 1,651 (48%) patients aged 50 years and older were managed without CTPA.</li>\n<li>If the age adjusted D-dimer cutoffs had been applied to the YEARS subgroup, 1,627 patients (47%) would have been managed without CTPA. This adjustment lead to an absolute increase of CTPA by 0.69%. This increase in CTPA did not result in a higher sensitivity but rather would have missed 4 PEs in patients that were confirmed on CTPA as they had one or more YEARS items and D-dimer &gt;500 ng/mL in the original YEARS study.</li>\n<li>The authors concluded in the YEARS cohort, there was no added value of implementing age adjusted D-dimer in the YEARS algorithm.</li>\n</ul>",
