Unlike the <calculator id=\"402\">ICH score</calculator>, which focuses on predicting 30-day mortality, this score focused on predicting functional independence at 90 days, defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale &gt; 4.</li>\n<li>The score was developed by <a href=\"http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/39/8/2304.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rost et al in 2008</a> using retrospective data that was in prospectively validated in 629 consecutive patients presenting with ICH. At 90 days, 26% of patients had functional independence.</li>\n<li>In the original data set, only patients with primary ICH were included. Patients with any of the following were excluded:\n<ul>\n<li>Vascular malformation</li>\n<li>CNS tumor</li>\n<li>Antecedent trauma</li>\n<li>Ischemic stroke</li>\n<li>Vasculitis</li>\n<li>Excessive anticoagulation (INR &gt;3.0)</li>\n<li>Any blood dyscrasia</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24132566\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Garrett et al in 2013</a> validated the FUNC score in a retrospective cohort of 501 patients, and found that it performed similarly or or better than alternative scores: the AUC for FUNC was 0.873, similar to 0.888 for ICH-GS and better than 0.743 for oICH.</li>\n<li>Study authors performed a subgroup analysis on patients who survived to 90 days post-ICH to account for any bias introduced by early withdrawal of care. Their work demonstrated that the FUNC score reliably predicted functional independence in this group as well, suggesting that it is not substantially affected by the decision to withdrawal care. This subgroup comparison is included in our calculator to more closely reflect the analysis groups in the original literature and to provide additional guidance to clinicians.</li>\n</ul>",
