Four variables with the strongest association were selected (BMI, FEV<sub>1</sub>, mMRC Dyspnea Scale, 6 Minute Walk Test).</p> <p>Selected patients were in clinically stable condition on appropriate therapy and stable oxygen requirements for 6 months. Patients with asthma, inability to perform bronchodilator or 6 Minute Walk Test, myocardial infarction within four months, unstable angina, or NYHA class III or IV CHF were excluded.</p> <p>The BODE Index was prospectively validated by the same authors in 625 patients across centers in the US, Spain and Venezuela. It performed well to predict death from any cause and death from respiratory cause, with an increase in hazard ratio of 1.34 and 1.62, respectively, for each point increase in the BODE Index.</p> <p>A subsequent study by <a href=\"http://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(15)49622-9/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ong et al</a> in <em>Chest</em> assessed the BODE Index as a predictor of hospitalizations for COPD. The study was completed in 2005 at a university affiliated hospital in Singapore and followed 127 patients with COPD in the outpatient setting. The authors found that the BODE Index performed better than the 2003 GOLD guidelines to predict COPD-related hospital admissions.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611108003557\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish study</a>, also by Celli, of 275 patients over 8 years demonstrated that the BODE Index predicted the number and severity of COPD exacerbations better than FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p>",
