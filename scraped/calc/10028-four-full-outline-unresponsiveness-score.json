            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The FOUR Score was originally developed to create an alternative to the <calculator id=\"64\">GCS</calculator> in evaluating patients with impaired consciousness and possible neurological injury. Given the categories included, the FOUR Score provides greater neurological information and includes key components of a basic neurological examination of a critically-ill patient. This was initially found to have good inter-rater reliability&nbsp;and prognostication in the neurological/neurosurgical intensive care unit (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16178024/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wijdicks 2005</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This score was then further assessed in other settings where neurological complications can arise, such as the medical intensive care unit&nbsp;and the emergency department. Even without specific neurological training, the inter-rater&nbsp;reliability remained high, allowing for consistent assessment of patients in these settings (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18807215\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stead 2009</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19648386\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iyer 2009</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In summary, while the GCS is currently the most common score used both in the field&nbsp;and in the hospital, there are significant limitations in this score due to reliance on verbal responses. The FOUR Score eliminates this confounding factor and adds on objective information from a basic neurological coma examination that can provide both prognostic&nbsp;and clinical information to help guide management.</p>",

Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main reason to develop the FOUR Score was the major shortcomings of the Glasgow Coma Scale. When communicating the GCS, I always felt I remained uninformed and also noted poor use of its individual components with many physicians resorting to a handy sum score (i.e., GCS 3, GCS 8, GCS 14). The FOUR Score is easy to use and has been validated in numerous studies in numerous countries, and is rapidly becoming the most validated scale in neurology.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the FOUR Score? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FOUR Score tests crucial brainstem reflexes and provides information about the severity of brainstem injury which are unavailable with the GCS. The FOUR Score recognizes a locked-in syndrome and a possible vegetative state. The FOUR Score includes signs suggesting brain herniation. Attention to respiratory patterns in the FOUR Score may not only indicate a need for intubation in comatose patients, but also provides information about the presence of a respiratory drive. The FOUR Score further characterizes the severity of the comatose state in patients with the lowest GCS scores of 3-4.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the FOUR Score? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our experience over the last decade is that the FOUR Score has been greeted with great enthusiasm, not only physicians but all healthcare workers involved with the care of the comatose patient. The FOUR Score is working well and no modification has been needed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you use the FOUR Score in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have fully implemented in our neurosciences ICU and it is available in our electronic medical record.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you&rsquo;re particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p>We are currently looking at its predictive value for deterioration in a number of ways.</p>"
