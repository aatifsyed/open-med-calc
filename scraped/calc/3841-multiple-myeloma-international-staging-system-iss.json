All patients were about to start therapy, ~70% through a clinical trial, and were from North America, Europe, and Asia. Approximately 25% received high-dose therapy/stem cell transplant. Median age was 60-63 years.</li> <li>A randomly selected training set was created and analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis, selecting serum beta-2 microglobulin and serum albumin as the dominant independent prognostic factors, best utilized in a survival tree model.</li> <li>This model classified patients in 3 risk groups: <ul> <li>Stage I- median overall survival 62 months;</li> <li>Stage II- 45 months;</li> <li>Stage III- 29 months.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The ISS was then validated in a separate group of patients from the same database with virtually identical results. It was validated further by geography, patient age, and treatment type.</li> <li>This model has been refined further as the Revised ISS (R-ISS). It includes validated and reliable prognostic factors for MM, including ISS score, cytogenetic abnormalities, and LDH. It identifies 3 groups with clearly different outcomes. It recharacterized ~ 25% of patients who would have been identified as good risk using only one of the validated factors into a higher risk category.</li> </ul>",
