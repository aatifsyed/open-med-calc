The rule was found to be <b>100%</b> sensitive for all intracranial injuries and had a specificity of 25%.</li>\n<li>6.5% of patients had intracranial injuries on CT (93/1429) and of those, 0.4% (6/1429) required neurosurgical intervention.</li>\n<li>Subsequent studies have found the NOC to have a sensitivity of 86-100% for intracranial injuries.There is conflicting evidence as to whether the NOC performs better than the CCHR for detecting all clinically significant intracranial injuries, with two validation trials finding that both had 100% sensitivity for these injuries, another trial2 finding that the NOC was more sensitive (99.4 vs. 87.2%) and one additional trial finding that the CCHR was more sensitive for detecting clinically significant intracranial injuries (95 vs. 86%).</li>\n<li>Regardless, in all settings the NOC has been shown to be less specific than the CCHR (50.6% vs 12.7%1, 39.7% vs. 5.6%2, 36.3% vs. 10.2%3 and 65% vs. 28%4).</li>\n<li>Another issue is the interrater reliability of applying the NOC vs. the CCHR. The kappa values for physician interpretation of the rules, CCHR vs NOC, were 0.85 vs 0.47. Physicians misinterpreted the rules as not requiring imaging for 4.0% of patients according to CCHR and 5.5% according to NOC (P = .04)1.</li>\n<li>The New Orleans Criteria have been validated in several settings and to 100% sensitivity for detecting injuries that will require neurosurgery.\n<ul>\n<li>There is an outlier study based on patients evaluated in a center in Tunisia that found the NOC to only be 82% sensitive (25/1017 patients with GCS 15 who were NOC negative, or 2.5%) for injuries that required neurosurgical intervention.</li>\n<li>There has been at least one trial that found the NOC was more sensitive than the CCHR (99.4% vs 87.3%). Though this comes at the price of markedly decreased specificity (5.6% vs. 39.7%).</li>\n<li>In United States, Canada and the Netherlands, both the NOC and the CCHR have demonstrated 100% sensitivity for ruling out intracranial injuries that would require neurosurgical intervention.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</dt><dd>As a resident at the University of Pittsburgh, I was convinced that CT was overused in patients with minor head injury (MHI). When I became faculty at Charity Hospital in New Orleans, I was much wiser and less cavalier, noting that occasionally some patients with MHI really did have badness on CT. But not very many, and usually it was quite unexpected. As a county hospital, we had little funds available for research, but I plied the residents with candy and ended up enrolling over 1,000 patients.</dd><dt>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the New Orleans/Charity Head Injury/Trauma Rule? Are there cases in which it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</dt><dd>Users should be aware that the original data set only included patients with either loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia, although subsequent studies have shown that the 'rule' is equally sensitive in patients without loss of consciousness. The mnemonic HEAD CT'S can be used to remember the seven criteria: headache, emesis, age over 60, drug or alcohol intoxication, convulsion, trauma visible above the clavicles, and short-term memory deficits. Several definitions are important when using this rule. Trauma visible above the clavicles implies any bruises, contusions or lacerations. Short-term memory deficits are defined as loss of anterograde amnesia, not the expected retrograde amnesia.</dd><dt>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the New Orleans/Charity Head Injury/Trauma Rule? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score given recent changes in medicine like imaging or the research we now have on concussion?</dt><dd>Clinical decision rules do not replace clinical judgment.</dd></dl>"
