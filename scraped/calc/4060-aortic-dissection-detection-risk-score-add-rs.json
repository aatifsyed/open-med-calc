Of 2,538 patients with acute aortic dissection, 2,430 (95.7%) were identified by 1 or more of 12 proposed clinical risk markers. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The IRAD investigators (<a href=\"https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/119/20/2702.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Suzuki et al</a> in 2009) also performed a prospective multicenter study of 220 patients with initial suspicion acute aortic dissection, of whom 87 were ultimately diagnosed with acute aortic dissection. The widely used cutoff of 500 ng/mL also showed promise with regard to ruling out AAS, with a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.07 throughout the first 24 hours, and a sensitivity of 96.6%.</p>\n<p>The ADvISED Trial (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29030346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nazerian et al</a>, 2018), working off of the foundation of the above two studies, designed and tested the ADD-RS / D-Dimer novel clinical pathway for ruling out acute aortic dissection, combining clinical risk stratification with D-dimer as a serum biomarker. It is a multicenter prospective observational study that enrolled 1,850 consecutive chest pain patients, 241 (13%) of which were diagnosed with AAS. &nbsp;ADD-RS &le;1 and negative D-dimer demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.8%, NPV 99.7%, and LR- 0.02.</p>\n<p>Shortcomings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients can only get one point per category, e.g. a patient with a new AI murmur and a focal neuro deficit and no other high risk features would still get only one point.</li>\n<li>Half of the patients in the study did not get definitive imaging and follow up was only 14 days, raising the question of possible missed cases.</li>\n<li>Criteria for entry into the study were determined by the provider.</li>\n<li>Like all of the above studies, the prevalence of AAS in this study was considerably higher than seen in previous studies. &nbsp;It is unclear how AAD-RS and D-dimer will perform in lower risk groups.</li>\n</ul>",
