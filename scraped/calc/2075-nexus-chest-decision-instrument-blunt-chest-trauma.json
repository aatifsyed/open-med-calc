Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</dt> <dd>I began this line of research over a decade ago, when (during a shift) I noticed that we were getting so many negative chest X-rays (CXRs) in blunt trauma patients. The CXR appeared to be a completely reflexive thing and the vast majority of our studies were non-diagnostic. With an EM resident (Anna Bjoring), I started a pilot study and recruited NEXUS colleagues from UCLA (Bill Mower) and UCSF-Fresno (Greg Hendey). We have followed the path and methods put forth by our mentor Jerry Hoffman in his landmark <calculator id='703'>NEXUS C-Spine</calculator> work.</dd> <dt>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument for Blunt Chest Trauma? Are there cases in which it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</dt> <dd>This is a great question. Misapplication of decision rules can paradoxically lead to greater imaging. As with essentially all imaging decision rules, NEXUS Chest was derived and validated only for the purpose of <strong>ruling out</strong> injury, not ruling it in. In other words, finding one or more NEXUS Chest criteria does not mean you must image that patient. We suggest using NEXUS Chest only in patients whom you were planning to image. Then apply NEXUS Chest to find out whether you can safely forego imaging.</dd> <dt>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument for Blunt Chest Trauma? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the instrument given recent changes in medicine?</dt> <dd>NEXUS Chest is easy to implement in conjunction with NEXUS C-Spine. Three criteria (altered alertness, intoxication and distracting injury) are the same and a fourth (chest wall tenderness) is analogous to the midline cervical spine tenderness criterion. We suggest that you use them in tandem for rapid evaluation of blunt trauma patients.</dd> <dt>Other comments? Any new research or papers on this topic in the pipeline?</dt> <dd>We have recently completed multicenter derivation and validation of our next rules in this line of research--the NEXUS Chest CT Decision Instruments. Using simple clinical criteria, these rules will allow trauma providers to forego chest CT in approximately 25-37% of blunt trauma patients who would otherwise get it. We hope to publish the manuscript describing this important study within the next 3 months.</dd> </dl>"
