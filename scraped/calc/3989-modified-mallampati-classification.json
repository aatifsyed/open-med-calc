Multiple large studies involving tens of thousands of patients have shown a reliable association between higher Mallampati score (class III or IV) and difficult laryngoscopy and intubation.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the Mallampati score does have its detractors. Green &amp; Roback rightly argue in their <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30782435/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2019 paper</a> that despite the high association seen with higher Mallampati class and difficult intubation, the sensitivity of the score is rather low, which is suboptimal for a screening test. Green &amp; Roback advocate for the use of the Mallampati score in the context of the total clinical picture. Furthermore, in the emergency setting, a patient with a failing airway or respiratory effort requiring intubation will still require intubation, regardless of the Mallampati score. Although a higher Mallampati score may prompt an earlier call to anesthesia or other specialties for assistance, its application to the emergent setting (ED, ICU) may be limited, as the score was initially developed and has primarily been validated in the OR setting.</p>",
