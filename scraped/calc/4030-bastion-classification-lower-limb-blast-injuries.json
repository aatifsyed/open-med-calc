Currently existing lower limb injury classification systems fail to describe the complete injury pattern or correlate with management. The Internal Committee of the Red Cross classification is broad and does not provide information on the severity of injury. The <calculator id=\"549\">Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS)</calculator>, Gustilo and Anderson, and Muller-AO classifications do not provide information on injury level. Muller-AO also does not take into account soft tissue injury. The secondary aim of the study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613453\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobs et al</a> was to facilitate the assessment of interventions. The Bastion Classification did show a predictable association with the level of initial musculoskeletal debridement and/or amputation and the level of vascular control.</p> <p>The original study was not designed to correlate class of injury with outcomes such as mortality, transfusion requirements, or definitive amputation level, and thus, this information is not provided in the publication nor conclusions made. </p> <p>A recent study in 2013 by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910814\" target=\"_blank\">Lundy and Hobbs</a> looked at 67 patients with 117 injured limbs caused by dismounted blast exposure. The authors noted that the Bastion Classification appeared to be predictive of initial musculoskeletal treatment but was less useful in predicting the need for proximal vascular control, especially in the most common Class 3 injuries. The original study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613453\" target=\"_blank\">Jacobs et al</a> showed Class 3 injuries correlated with a higher rate of intra- or extra-peritoneal iliac vessel control (23% of 83 Class 3 injured limbs without associated abdominal injuries) compared to the study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22910814\" target=\"_blank\">Lundy et al</a>, which only had 1 patient with a Class 3 injury without associated abdominal injury and 6 (5%) of all injured limbs requiring iliac vessel control. The 2013 study also does not comment on the Bastion Classification and mortality rates. </p>",
