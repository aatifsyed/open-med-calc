While many claim that the MASCC cannot be applied to patients with hematologic malignancies, over 40% of the patients included had a hematologic malignancy. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine a weighted risk score with a positive predictive value of 91%, specificity of 68%, and sensitivity of 71%.</p>\n<p>Of note, patients were only included in the study for a single episode of febrile neutropenia and were not allowed to re-enter the study for subsequent episodes; thus, it is unclear if the score should be applied to patients with multiple episodes of febrile neutropenia (though it is routinely done in clinical practice).</p>\n<p>There have been at least 8 external validation studies showing a positive predictive value (PPV) from 83-98% with sensitivity from 59-95%. Studies that included more patients with hematologic malignancies had lower PPV and sensitivity suggesting a poorer performance of the score in that population.</p>",
