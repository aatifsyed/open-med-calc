It was known that <calculator id=\"715\">NIHSS</calculator> and age were major predictors of stroke outcome, so we combined these elements with comorbidities in the score-building data set (the MERCI and Multi-MERCI trials). Three comorbidities were independent predictors in the models : hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Each comorbidity accounted for approximately the same risk of worsened outcome. We went on to validate the THRIVE score in the Merci Registry, the NINDS IV tPA trial, VISTA, the TREVO-2 trial, the SWIFT and STAR trials, and the SITS-MOST study. We found that the THRIVE score works well across the three major acute treatment contexts (IV tPA, endovascular stroke treatment, and no acute treatment) and that THRIVE predicts functional outcome, death after stroke, and the risk of brain hemorrhage after IV tPA administration.</p>"
