The model showed a concordance index (C-index) of 0.73 and patients classified into the different risk groups had significantly different overall survival.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The model was subsequently externally validated (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144042/\" target=\"_blank\">Heng 2013</a>) in 849 consecutive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma from 13 international cancer centres and was shown to compare favorably to 4 other risk models used in this setting: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model, Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) model, French model, and International Kidney Cancer Working Group (IKCWG) model.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The model has also been validated in patients with non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23696129\" target=\"_blank\">Kroeger 2013</a>), subsequent lines of therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681967\" target=\"_blank\">Ko 2015</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(16)30258-5/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Wells 2017</a>), and patients treated by immune checkpoint inhibitors (<a href=\"http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.35.6_suppl.492\" target=\"_blank\">Yip 2017</a>).</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-07f11c61-7fff-3a28-061a-cf8ee62e93c8\">Specific IMDC risk groups have also been shown to have better outcomes with certain systemic therapies. In particular, the IMDC intermediate and poor risk groups should be preferentially treated with first line nivolumab + ipilimumab or cabozantinib therapy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29562145\" target=\"_blank\">Motzer 2018</a>, <a href=\"http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2016.70.7398\" target=\"_blank\">Choueiri 2017</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">NCCN guidelines v3.2019</a>).
