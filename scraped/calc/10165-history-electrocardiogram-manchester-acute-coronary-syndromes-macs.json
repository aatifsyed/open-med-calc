The derivation cohort (796 patients) and validation cohorts (474 and 659 patients, respectively, in two separate data sets) presented within the same paper were secondary analyses from three prospective diagnostic accuracy studies that included patients presenting to the ED with suspected cardiac chest pain. The cohort for derivation and one of the validations were the same cohort used to derive and validate the T-MACS Score (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780911\" target=\"_blank\">Body 2014</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inclusion and exclusion criteria differed slightly between the derivation and validation sets, e.g. chest pain within 24 (derivation) vs 12 hours of onset (validation 2); age limits 25 years (derivation) vs 18 (validation 2) and exclusion of patients diagnosed with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (validation 2). While the negative predictive value (NPV) for \"very low\" risk patients was high, confidence intervals for the NPV in the validation studies are wide (up to 1 in 10 patients could be missed at the lowest end of the confidence interval).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The goal was to create a decision aid able to risk stratify patients presenting with suspected cardiac chest pain that did not rely on testing biomarkers enabling its use in environments where such testing is not available. Each study included ED patients presenting with chest pain that the treating clinician suspected might be cardiac in nature and warranted investigation for a possible ACS.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a reference standard for acute MI, all patients underwent serial cardiac troponin testing at local analyser appropriate time intervals. Patients were followed up throughout their inpatient course and at 30 days. One patient in the second validation set grouped as \"very low\" risk had ACS in the study but was found to have myocarditis on further investigation.</p>",
