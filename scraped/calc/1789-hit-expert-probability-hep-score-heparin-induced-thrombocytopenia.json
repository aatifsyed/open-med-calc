            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>In 50 suspected HIT patients, a literature review and expert-derived criteria of eight clinical features potentially important in the diagnosis of HIT were retrospectively applied in order to derive a HIT Expert Probability score for each patient. This score was then compared to a diagnosis of HIT by an expert panel of HIT experts. Using a cut-off of 2, the HEP score was 100% sensitive and 60% specific for the diagnosis of HIT. A cut-off of 5 yielded a sensitivity/specificity of 86%/88%, though its utility as a clinical decision tool is lessened with this cut-off. Both the HEP score and the <calculator id=\"1787\">4Ts for HIT score</calculator> had 100% sensitivity, but the HEP score had a higher specificity (60% vs 44%). A subsequent small validation study involving 47 patients with suspect HIT using a HEP score cut-off of 2 had a sensitivity of just 70% with a specificity of 51.4% and accuracy of 55.3%. A HEP score cut-off of -3 would be needed to yield a sensitivity of 100% as in the derivation study, but would also cause a fall in specificity to 2.7%.</p>",

Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</dt> <dd>As a first year hematology fellow, the most common reason for consultation in the hospital was suspected HIT. Often, the evaluations were not altogether satisfying. Perhaps out of fear of missing cases of true HIT and because of the poor specificity of the HIT ELISA, I felt that over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment in patients without HIT was common. Using drugs like argatroban in patients without HIT was not only costly but also exposed patients to increased bleeding risk without clear benefit. My goal was and continues to be to curb over-treatment and improve the diagnosis of HIT.</dd> <dt>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the HIT Expert Probability score? Are there cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</dt> <dd>In my opinion, the HEP score is not yet ready for clinical use. We are nearing completion of a large prospective study that compares the diagnostic accuracy of the HEP score to the 4Ts (another scoring system) and usual care. The results of this study should help us to understand the optimal method for estimating the pre-test probability of HIT.</dd> <dt>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have applied the HIT Expert Probability score? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score given recent changes in medicine?</dt> <dd>No, but as above, I would caution that the HEP score has not been prospectively validated or compared with other methods of clinical diagnosis. A study addressing these gaps will be completed soon.</dd> <dt>How would you compare the HIT Expert Probability score with other scores assessing risk of HIT?</dt> <dd>The most extensively studied scoring system for HIT is the 4T score. The 4T score is a robust means of excluding HIT -- a low probability 4T score has a negative predictive value of 99.8%. The positive predictive value is not as strong. The PPV of an intermediate and high probability score is 14% and 65%, respectively. The 4T score is also somewhat subjective and associated with suboptimal interobserver agreement. It remains to be seen how the HEP score fares in comparison to the 4T score in a prospective study.</dd> </dl>"
