            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The BRUE Criteria and risk stratification algorithm were created in 2016 as a <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/04/21/peds.2016-0590\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">clinical practice guideline</a> published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. A comprehensive review of the available ALTE literature was performed and used to inform key action statements. When definitive data was not available, expert consensus of a multidisciplinary committee was used.</p>\n<p>The guidelines were created with the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace the term apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).</li>\n<li>Allow stratification of patients who present with a BRUE into low and higher-risk categories.</li>\n<li>Provide evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and management of patient categorized as lower risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Risk in patients presenting with a BRUE was defined by risk of either adverse recurrent events or eventual diagnosis with a serious underlying disorder. Several studies in the ALTE literature have attempted to identify predictive variables of this risk.</p>\n<p>Claudius and Keens performed a prospective observational analysis of all children presenting with ALTE (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17403838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Claudius and Keens, 2007</a>). Of the 59 infants included, 8 were deemed to necessitate admission, with age &lt;30 days and the presence of multiple reported events identifying all patients. Prematurity was also noted to be a significant risk factor, though inclusion did not identify any additional patients.</p>\n<p>In a retrospective cohort study of 625 patients admitted for ALTE, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18950797\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Al-Kindy et al</a> identified risk factors for &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; vital sign changes (e.g. sustained bradycardia, apnea, or desaturation), including post-conceptional age &lt;43 weeks, premature birth, and URI symptoms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mittal et al</a> performed a prospective cohort study of 300 infants evaluated in the ER for ALTE. Logistic regression identified prematurity, abnormal physical examination, cyanotic color change, and the absence of URI symptoms and choking as significant predictors of need for admission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kaji et al</a> reported on factors predictive of need for admission in a multi-institution, observational cohort study of 832 patients presenting with ALTE. Aside from obvious need for admission at the time of initial evaluation (e.g. oxygen requirement), a significant medical history (e.g. cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease) and the presence of &gt;1 event in the preceding 24 hours identified the majority of patients requiring admission.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a systematic review of 37 studies by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23415612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tieder et al</a> sought to determine risk factors for future adverse events and/or serious underlying diagnosis. Risk factors included history of prematurity, multiple ALTEs, and suspected child maltreatment.</p>\n<p>Notably, the BRUE Criteria were created based on systematic review of the ALTE literature. As such, prospective studies are needed to define the true incidence of BRUE, determine final diagnoses and outcomes of both low and higher-risk infants, and elucidate the role and utility of diagnostic testing in higher-risk infants.</p>",
