It is defined as the involuntary return or reflux of previously swallowed food or secretions out of the stomach into and/or out of the mouth.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Infant regurgitation typically peaks at age 4 months, starts improving at 6 months and resolves by 12 months in 90% of infants.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If the infant is feeding well, gaining weight and is not excessively irritable, reassurance is the most important intervention.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There is no benefit of PPI treatment for infants with infant regurgitation.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">When the regurgitation of gastric contents causes complications such as tissue damage or inflammation (e.g. esophagitis, aspiration, feeding and swallowing problems, failure to thrive, etc), it is termed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&nbsp; Differentiating infant regurgitation from GERD can be challenging as symptoms overlap. Isolated symptoms of fussiness, crying and arching in an infant who is thriving and developing normally are unlikely related to GERD and care should be taken to avoid its overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Patients with prematurity, developmental delay, congenital abnormalities of the oropharynx, chest, lungs, CNS, heart, or GI tract are at increased risk for GERD. Further, evidence of failure to thrive, food refusal, hematemesis, occult or frank blood in the stool, neck posturing, and respiratory symptoms may suggest GERD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">It is important to distinguish regurgitation from vomiting because the latter can be a symptom of underlying anatomic abnormalities, metabolic, infectious or neurologic conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In case of a strong family history of food allergy, excessive irritability and/or presence of blood in the stool, milk protein allergy should be considered and treated accordingly.

Their mission is to improve the lives of people with DGBI. Over the last 3 decades, the Rome organization has sought to legitimize and update our knowledge of the DGBIs. This has been accomplished by bringing together scientists and clinicians from around the world to classify and critically appraise the science of GI function and dysfunction. This knowledge permits clinical scientists to make recommendations for diagnosis and treatment that can be applied in research and clinical practice. Diagnosis is based on the use of <a href=\"https://theromefoundation.org/rome-iv/rome-iv-criteria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">symptom-based criteria</a> which are used in clinical trials and daily practice.
