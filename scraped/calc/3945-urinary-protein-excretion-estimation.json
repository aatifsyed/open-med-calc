            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The use of UPEE as a correlate for 24-hour urinary protein excretion was first investigated by <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6656849\" target=\"_blank\">Ginsberg et al</a> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1983. They hypothesized that because urinary creatinine excretion is constant if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is constant, a calculated protein/creatinine ratio from a single urine sample should reflect protein excretion and, being a ratio, also cancel out the time factor.</p> <p>They tested their hypothesis in 46 patients with renal disease, measuring both (1) total protein from 24-hour urine collection and (2) protein/creatinine ratio from a random urine sample for each. They also collected random urine samples from 30 healthy controls with no history or evidence of renal disease and calculated protein/creatinine ratio from each. Comparing the 24-hour protein and random protein/creatinine ratio showed correlation coefficients ranging between 0.82-0.97.</p> <p>They also found that the relationship between proteinuria in random urine and 24-hour collection varied by as much as 30%, but that during “normal daylight activity” (i.e., when most random samples are likely to be collected) the variation was minimal.</p> <p>Numerous subsequent studies have validated this correlation, including by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3555378\" target=\"_blank\">Schwab et al (1987)</a> in inpatients and outpatients with renal disease, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6726514\" target=\"_blank\">Houser (1984)</a> in pediatric patients, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015502\" target=\"_blank\">Neithardt et al (2002)</a> in pregnant patients, and others.</p> <p>A systematic review by <a href=\"http://www.clinchem.org/content/51/9/1577.full\" target=\"_blank\">Price et al (2005)</a> evaluated 16 studies investigating proteinuria and used likelihood ratios to measure ability of random protein/creatinine ratio to predict presence or absence of proteinuria. Patient groups were primarily those with preeclampsia or renal disease. Summary estimates of the LR(+) and the LR(−) across the 10 preeclampsia studies were 4.2 (95% CI, 2.6–6.9) and 0.14 (0.09–0.24), respectively.</p> <p>Sensitivities and specificities for the tests ranged between 69-96% and 41%- 97%, respectively, whereas the positive and negative predictive values ranged between 46%-95% and 45%-98%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratios ranged between 1.8-16.5, and the negative likelihood ratios between 0.06-0.35.</p>",
