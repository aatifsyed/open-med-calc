            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The GOLD Criteria were first described by the <a href=\"http://www.goldcopd.com\" target=\"_blank\">Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)</a> in 2001 as a point-of-care means of assessing and characterizing the severity of COPD. The original 2001 GOLD Criteria, as well as the 2006 update, were defined by the FEV₁ percent predicted: the worse the FEV₁ percent predicted, the worse a patient’s disease severity. The original, spirometrically-based GOLD Criteria were widely disseminated and widely used clinically, as the criteria represented an easy to use clinical tool that was linked to treatment interventions.</p> <p>Increasing awareness of the importance of symptoms, coupled with increased visibility and psychometric characterization of symptom scores such as the mMRC and CAT, led to a major <a href='http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201204-0596PP' target='_blank'>revision in the GOLD Criteria</a> in 2011. Specifically, symptom burden (as measured by the mMRC or CAT) and exacerbation frequency were coupled to FEV₁ percent predicted to generate a more comprehensive disease severity assessment tool.</p> <p>The revised and updated 2011 GOLD Criteria were demonstrated to be more accurate with regard to predicting COPD exacerbations (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22997207\" target=\"_blank\">Lange</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187891\" target=\"_blank\">Soriano</a>), although there does not appear to be a difference in predicting mortality as compared to the 2001 and 2006 GOLD guidelines (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23611880\" target=\"_blank\">Leivseth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187891\" target=\"_blank\">Soriano</a>). Perceptions of confusion in coupling three different metrics of disease severity (FEV₁, symptom burden, and exacerbation frequency) led to the 2017 GOLD guidelines to separate FEV₁ from symptom burden and exacerbation frequency (see Formula), to establish the GOLD stage A, B, C, or D.</p> <p>The data regarding accuracy and reliability for clinical outcomes associated with GOLD stages A-D are primarily retrospective in nature and entirely descriptive of the GOLD 2011 criteria (there are no data for the GOLD 2017 guidelines). A large study from Denmark assessed 6,628 patients demonstrated a sequential increase in exacerbation frequency from GOLD stage A (2.2% per year) to GOLD stage D (28.6% per year), with an increase in mortality from GOLD stage A to D, but a decrease in mortality from GOLD B to C (see table in Facts & Figures) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22997207\" target=\"_blank\">Lange</a>). A second retrospective study in Spain assessed 3,633 patients with COPD (93% men), and demonstrated a sequential increase in mortality over 10 years for patients stratified as GOLD A, B, C, and D (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187891\" target=\"_blank\">Soriano</a>).</p> <p>Data regarding the performance characteristics of and clinical outcomes associated with GOLD 2017 staging is anticipated to be forthcoming, and will likely be similar to GOLD 2011 performance given the similarities in the construction and composition of the 2011 and 2017 GOLD Criteria.</p>",
