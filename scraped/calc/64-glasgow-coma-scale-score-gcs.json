Reproducibility of the total GCS Score was also high, with kappa greater than 0.6 in 77% of observations. Education and training on usage of the scale resulted in A clear beneficial effect on reliability (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reith 2016</a>).</li>\n<li>In its most common usage, the three sections of the scale are often summed to provide a summary of severity. The authors themselves have explicitly objected to the score being used in this way, and analysis has shown that patients with the same total score can have huge variations in outcomes, specifically mortality (GCS score of 4 predicts a mortality rate of 48% if calculated 1+1+2 for eye, verbal, and motor, a mortality of 27% if calculated 1+2+1, but a mortality of only 19% if calculated 2+1+1 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12707528\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healey 2014</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, the Modified Glasgow Coma Scale provides a nearly universally accepted method of assessing patients with acute brain damage. Summation of its components into a single overall score loses information and provides only a rough guide to severity. In some circumstances, such as early triage of severe injuries, assessment of only a contracted version of the motor component of the scale, as in the <calculator id=\"1832\">Simplified Motor Scale (SMS)</calculator> can perform as well the GCS and is significantly less complicated. However, the <calculator id=\"1832\">SMS</calculator> may be less informative in patients with lesser injuries.</p>",

              "qa_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you develop the Glasgow Coma Scale? Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a junior doctor in the early 1970s, I saw that crucial decisions on patients with an acute brain injury were being taken on the findings of a chaotic mixture of many different, ill-defined systems for assessing their so-called &ldquo;conscious level.&rdquo; I saw how this created confusion about the severity of a patient's condition, how it undermined communication, and how this led to delays in detecting and acting on clinical changes and, most importantly, to avoid morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A better system of assessment was also needed to support <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Jennett\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Jennett's</a> interests in prognosis by relating a patient's early severity to their outcome. We aimed for a method that would be widely acceptable, covering the spectrum of degrees of injury from many causes &ndash; beyond specialist neurosurgical units where only a minority of patients are managed. The result was deliberately called simply, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4136544\" target=\"_blank\">A practical scale for assessment of impaired consciousness and coma.</a>&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Glasgow Coma Scale? Are there cases in which it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First: distinguish between the use of the Scale and its derived total or sum Score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The purpose of the Scale is to describe and communicate the condition of an individual patient by separate, multidimensional rating of their eye, verbal and motor responses. It remains the appropriate method for this purpose.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Score came a couple of years later. We had assigned numbers to the steps in each response so that they could be readily used in research; the temptation to aggregate the 3 into a total score became irresistible! The total score is very useful as a summary of severity in groups and in classification. It does provide a rough index in an individual but conveys less information than the scale. If one or other response cannot be assessed, a total score cannot be derived but the information in the remaining responses of the scale can still inform management.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second: the reliability of the scale can be high, but cannot be assumed, nor left to chance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the course of a review of the scale I became aware that over the years of the emergence of quite wide variations both in how it is assessed and in the level of reproducibility. Consistent assessment is promoted by training and experience and to support these we have set up a website containing a video setting out a standard, structured approach (<a href=\"http://www.glasgowcomascale.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlasgowComaScale.org</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the scale given recent changes in medicine like imaging, or the data and research we now have on concussion?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I've often considered the need for changes and am aware of many proposals. Derivatives from the scale have been described but have reflected limited perspectives. A view that it is too complex has led to an assessment limited to only 3 steps in the motor scale, the Simplified Motor Scale; this may have application in immediate triage in severe injuries but is inadequate for the great majority of patients with lesser injuries. Views that a more elaborate system incorporating more features is needed, for example in neuro intensive care, overlook that it was always intended that other signs should be assessed, but alongside the scale, not lumped into even more complex scores.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The scale seems still to be valuable in providing a common language across the full spectrum of responsiveness in a wide range of clinical circumstances. I have not been persuaded that changes are appropriate, apart from simplifying and tidying up some of the terms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Assessment of a patient with the scale and the use of other investigations such as imaging have interacting and overlapping places in management. The findings of the scale provide indications for performing imaging, and for then interpreting the clinical implications of its findings. A scan doesn't tell you what the patient is like.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The challenge in working on concussion is the lack of an independent, biologically sound, way of separating it out sharply and definitely within the spectrum of mild, trauma-induced brain disturbances. Agreement on practical, operational thresholds, perhaps based on degrees and durations of impairment of orientation and eye opening, might help research and clinical care.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other comments? Any new research or papers on this topic in the pipeline? Having developed the tool in 1974, any thoughts on how widespread its use has become (even being applied to atraumatic changes in consciousness)?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 40th birthday of the scale was the lever used by some colleagues to stimulate me to join them in conducting a thorough review of how it had fared, where it is now and what might be appropriate in future.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The outputs from this include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(14)70120-6/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\">Teasdale G, Maas A, Lecky F, Manley G, Stocchetti N, Murray G.
