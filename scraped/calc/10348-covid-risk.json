This may be for several reasons: (1) it&rsquo;s based initially on the VA population of patients, which may be somewhat unique, (2) capturing these risk factors may already capture the health differences between races, (3) remember, this does not predict your chance of getting COVID-19, which has been shown to be higher in certain populations. It estimates your chance of dying if you get COVID-19.</span></p>",

What is the VACO Index?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The VACO Index uses your pre-COVID health status to estimate your risk of dying from COVID-19. Knowing your risk can better help you understand what's at stake if you don't take the necessary precautions to stay safe.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This tool was developed by Dr. Amy Justice, Dr. Joseph King, and others from Yale University and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System in collaboration with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the CDC, NIH, VA, and the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Who does this apply to?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You can use it on yourself, your family, your friends (anyone, really) to help understand the risk - and potentially provide guidance for preventative measures (e.g. social distancing, exposure, more). It&rsquo;s best used on infected or newly infected patients, as the way the VACO Index is designed, it does not get worse or better based on clinical symptoms and lab values.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. If my rate of death is low, is there anything else to worry about?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Yes, keep in mind COVID-19 can do permanent damage even if it doesn&rsquo;t kill the patient. This tool does NOT measure that type of damage.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is the death rate from COVID-19 similar to that of the flu?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Typically, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is <strong>8-12 times HIGHER</strong> than the risk of dying from the flu. After you calculate a result, click on the yellow &ldquo;Visualize Results&rdquo; button to see a breakdown of your risk.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Who created this tool?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">The VACO Index was developed by Drs. King and Justice from Yale/VA in collaboration with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the CDC, NIH, VA, and the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response. See <a href=\"#creator-insights\">Creator Insights</a> for more info.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What is MDCalc?</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">MDCalc is a physician-run medical reference for clinical decision tools and content, used by doctors around the world including â…” of U.S. doctors weekly. We are proud to work with the HHS, the ASPR, and the VACO Index creators to help get this important tool in use. See our <a href=\"https://www.mdcalc.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">About Us</a> page for more info.</p>\n<p>If you believe you have been exposed to or have COVID-19, talk with your doctor.</p>",
