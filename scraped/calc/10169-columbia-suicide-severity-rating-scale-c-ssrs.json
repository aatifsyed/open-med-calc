The constructs were based on factors identified in previous studies found to be predictive of suicide attempts and completed suicide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a study of 3,776 patients who had a baseline C-SSRS and at least one follow-up C-SSRS, sensitivity and specificity of positive reports for identifying suicidal behaviors were found to be 67% and 76%, respectively (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mundt 2013</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similar findings have been reproduced by others. In a longitudinal study of 1,055 adults admitted to a psychiatric hospital, the C-SSRS was found to have excellent internal consistency (alpha = 0.95), with the summary score and total score revealing adequate classification for suicide-related behavior within six months (sensitivity 69%, specificity 65-67%) (<a href=\"https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/article/Pages/2016/v77n07/v77n0705.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Madan 2016</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-befa962e-7fff-80f9-827f-b97eff8e00cd\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The C-SSRS has been used in numerous trials and has been extensively validated in several subpopulations, including children as young as five years old (<a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/24337449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glennon 2014</a>), veterans with concomitant posttraumatic stress disorder (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Legarreta 2015</a>), and outpatients in a psychiatry clinic (<a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/26278339\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Viguera 2015</a>). The C-SSRS has been translated for use to 30+ languages other than English (<a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82148274.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gratalup 2013</a>).</p>",
