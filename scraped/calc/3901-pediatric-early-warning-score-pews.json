The criteria were revised based on a pilot that identified patients who deteriorated who were not identified by the original score.</p>\n<p>Several studies have validated the PEWS, including one by Duncan et al which found an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90, with 78% sensitivity and 95% specificity at a score of 5.</p>",
