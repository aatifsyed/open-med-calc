            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<ul>\n<li>A validation study looking only at patients with pathology confirmed necrotizing fasciitis showed that a LRINEC cut-off of 6 for necrotizing fasciitis only had a sensitivity of 59.2% and a specificity of 83.8%, yielding a PPV of 37.9% and NPV of 92.5%. However, the study did show that severe cellulitis had a LRINEC &ge;6 only 16.2% of the time. Other validation studies have shown similarly poor sensitivities and specificities.</li>\n<li>A subsequent retrospective analysis of patients with confirmed necrotizing fasciitis also showed that LRINEC scores &ge;6 were also associated with statistically significant increases in mortality and amputation rates.</li>\n<li>The original derivation study was a retrospective observational study looking at laboratory differences between patients with confirmed necrotizing fasciitis and those with severe cellulitis or abscess. They derived six criteria, CRP, WBC count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine and glucose, assigning each of them a point value from 0-4. Using a cut-off of &ge;6 for necrotizing fasciitis, they then retrospectively applied the criteria to separate cohorts of necrotizing fasciitis and severe cellulitis/abscess patients drawn from a similar population as the derivation study. They found that a LRINEC score &ge;6 had a sensitivity of approximately 90% and a specificity of approximately 95%, PPV 92% and NPV 95%. However, this cut-off still missed 10% of patients with necrotizing fasciitis. Subsequent studies of the LRINEC score yielded even poorer sensitivities of around 60% and a specificity in the 80% range. A LRINEC score of &ge;6 could be used as a potential tool to rule in necrotizing fasciitis, but a score &lt;6 should not be used to rule out the diagnosis.</li>\n</ul>",
