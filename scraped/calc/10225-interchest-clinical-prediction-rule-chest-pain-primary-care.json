            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule was developed by combining patient-level data from five studies of chest pain in primary care.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Individual patient-level data were mathematically combined, and regression modeling was used to identify the clinical characteristics most predictive for the exclusion of CAD.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The original studies were conducted in Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and the USA. It is unclear to what extent this rule may be generalized to patients in dissimilar social or cultural settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Studies that contributed to development of the <calculator id=\"4022\">Marburg Heart Score (MHS)</calculator> were included in this meta-analysis. While the INTERCHEST rule has a comparable NPV (2%) and higher PPV (43%) to the MHS, the INTERCHEST rule has not yet been externally validated in an population separate from the derivation study.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While INTERCHEST and the MHS&nbsp;have comparable&nbsp;NPV for excluding CAD (~97-98%), INTERCHEST has a higher&nbsp;PPV for predicting the presence of CAD (43% vs 23%). However the INTERCHEST prediction rule has not yet been validated by separate studies to the same degree as the MHS. In short, the INTERCHEST rule is better at predicting the presence of CAD but has been less well studied.<br /><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-56e48f21-7fff-f6cf-92b1-2f0a94b1e2e8\"></p>",
