The original model designated four criteria: tonsillar exudates, swollen tender anterior cervical nodes, absence of a cough, and history of fever. Patients exhibiting all four variables had a 56% probability of a Group A beta strep positive culture; three variables, 32%; two variables, 15%; one variable, 6.5%; and zero variables, 2.5%.</p>\n<p>The Centor Score was later modified to include age (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9475915\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McIsaac 1998</a>) and validated (<a href=\"https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=198485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McIsaac 2004</a>) for use in both children and adults presenting with sore throat. McIsaac et al (1998) determined that using the Centor Score would reduce the number of unnecessary initial antibiotic prescriptions by 48%, without an increase in throat culture use.</p>\n<p>The Centor Score and its modifications were derived in relatively small samples (n=286 and n=521, respectively). In order to more precisely classify the risk of GAS infection, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627733/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fine et al (2012)</a> performed a national-scale validation of the score on a geographically diverse population of over 140,000 patients presenting in a clinical setting. The study was carried out over the course of more than a year, mitigating any impact of seasonality of GAS incidence on the results. This analysis provided more precise interpretations of risk for each category of the Centor Score; these still fell within the 95% confidence interval of Centor's original study with a much smaller sample size.</p>\n<p>In their comparison of the Centor Score with other identification and treatment strategies, McIsaac et al (2004) found that use of the score resulted in fewer overall tests (cultures and rapid tests) per person but more throat cultures (96.1% of adults) than other strategies. As a result, the Centor Score represented a compromise, requiring the least diagnostic testing, providing 100% sensitivity and greater than 90% specificity in both children and adults, and producing significant reductions in unnecessary use of antibiotics, compared to other strategies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2481815\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harris et al (2016)</a> encourage the use of the Centor Score primarily to identify patients with a low probability of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis who do not warrant further testing, citing the criteria's low positive predictive value.</p>",

Was there a clinical experience that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong><br /> In 1979, while working in the \"non-acute\" adult emergency room, a resident asked me how to evaluate a sore throat patient. Having just finished my residency, I started to give a definitive answer, but had a moment of humility and told him that I did not know. We made a treatment decision at the time, and I went to the library to learn more. A wonderful microbiologist agreed to do some throat cultures for us, and I developed a questionnaire. Our goal was to see if clinical findings could stratify the probability that an adult (16 and older in our ER) patient had group A Strep.</p>\n<p><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the Centor Score? Are there cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong><br /> We studied adults, and thus have always been wary of applying it to children. More recently, we have published a review that shows that pre-adolescent pharyngitis has many differences from adolescent/young adult pharyngitis. McIsaac has developed an adjustment for age which might be appropriate for pre-adolescents.</p>\n<p>Please do not use this score if the patient does not have a recent onset acute pharyngitis (3 days or less). Some have erred in using this for any throat discomfort.</p>\n<p><strong>What recommendations do you have for health care providers once they have the Centor Score result? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score given recent changes in medicine?</strong><br /> Our recent research suggests that our Score stratifies not just group A strep, but also groups C&amp;G strep and Fusobacterium necrophorum. Because we believe that we should treat all of these bacteria, we favor narrow antibiotics (preferably penicillin, amoxicillin or a narrow spectrum cephalosporin) for scores of 3 or 4. Depending on clinical assessment, we sometimes will also treat the 2s. Zeros and 1s need no testing or antibiotics. All patients should be told that pharyngitis is generally self limited and should improve over the next 2-5 days. If symptoms worsen, then the differential diagnosis broadens and the score is not longer relevant. Major red flags include rigors and inability to swallow secondary to pain. These patients need further evaluation, and likely hospitalization.<br /><br /><strong>Any further research you're working on related to resource utilization and sore throat?</strong><br /> We continue to study the importance of <em>Fusobacterium necrophorum,</em>&nbsp;an obligate anaerobe that causes endemic pharyngitis in adolescents and young adults. This bacteria is very important because it is the most common cause of peritonsillar abscess in the 15-30 age group, and the primary cause of Lemierre Syndrome.</p>"
