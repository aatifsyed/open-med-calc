            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The values of <em>both</em> CPP and ICP should be included in clinical decision-making. There is extensive data linking the use of both of these metrics to decreased mortality. The definition of normal ICP varies in the literature, but commonly-applied normal ranges are as follows: </p> <ul> <li>Supine adults: 5–15 mmHg or 7–15 mmHg</li> <li>Supine children: 3–7 mmHg</li> <li>Supine infants: 1–5 mmHg or 1–6 mmHg</li> </ul> <p><strong>Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines recommend treating an ICP &gt;22 mmHg</strong> due to evidence showing increased mortality above this threshold.</p> <p>The definition of normal CPP also varies in the literature. However, the <strong>Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines define normal CPP at 60–70 mmHg.</strong></p> <p>Although the details and definitions may vary, overall the data overwhelmingly support the use of ICP monitoring and CPP targets in patients with severe TBI (GCS ≤8). One large (n = 2,320) multicenter observational study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098983\" target=\"_blank\">Gerber et al</a> looked at a 9-year period in which increased adherence to the Brain Trauma Foundation management guidelines regarding use of ICP and CPP targets was correlated with significantly improved mortality, making the case for clinical application of these guidelines. Specifically, they found that as the rate of use of ICP monitoring increased (56% to 75%), and adherence to CPP target thresholds increased (15% to 48%), overall fatality decreased (22% to 13%).</p> <p>Increasing a patient’s CPP does come with potential risks. Multiple studies have shown an increased risk of hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS in those patients treated to a target CPP &gt;70 mmHg. In a single-center RCT comparing ICP-directed management versus cerebral blood flow-directed (CBF-directed) management, the latter of which involved maintaining CPP &gt;70 mmHg, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11596949\" target=\"_blank\">Contant et al</a> found a fivefold higher risk of ARDS in patients in the CBF-directed management group (15% versus 3.3%).</p> <p>In a retrospective cohort study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16215372\" target=\"_blank\">Cremer et al</a>, the study investigators found that, among those TBI patients who survived 24 hours past the initial brain injury, CPP evaluation to guide clinical decision-making was associated with no difference in mortality, but doubled the number of ventilator-dependent days (5 vs. 12). However, the cohort of patients for whom CPP evaluation was used to guide care in this study were treated to a target CPP &gt;70 mmHg, therefore it is not surprising that these patients required longer mechanical ventilation.</p> <p>Other studies have found no additional mortality benefit to maintaining CPP &gt;70 mmHg. Thus, targeting a CPP &gt;70 mmHg is not recommended, as it is associated with increased complications without increased benefit.</p>",
