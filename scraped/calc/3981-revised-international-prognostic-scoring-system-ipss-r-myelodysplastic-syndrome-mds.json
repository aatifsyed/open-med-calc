The <a href=\"http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/89/6/2079.long?sso-checked=true\" target=\"_blank\">revised IPSS</a> (IPSS-R) was developed in 7,012 patients and added some additional cytogenetic abnormalities and used specific blood count value ranges in the calculation. The IPSS had four categories, while the IPSS-R has better discrimination with five categories. Both scores have been validated; however, the IPSS-R is more frequently used and is more precise. The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/leu201555a.html\" target=\"_blank\">validation</a> for the IPSS-R was performed on 200 external patients and outperformed the IPSS. &nbsp;</p>",
