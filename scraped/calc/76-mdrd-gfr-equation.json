The derivation cohort included 1070 patients and the validation cohort 558 patients. The equation has since been validated more extensively in a variety of populations, though it remains useful primarily for patients with impaired kidney function (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m). The equation has not been validated in patients greater than 70 years old, though it is still applied in these patients.
