This demonstrated no difference for reduction of recurrent pancreatitis at 1 year between patients randomized to dual biliary and pancreatic sphincterotomy versus biliary sphincterotomy alone. In addition, both groups had nearly 50% recurrence rates at 6 month follow-up. Given its increased risk with no demonstrated benefit, dual sphincterotomy is often not recommended over biliary sphincterotomy alone in patients with recurrent acute idiopathic pancreatitis. </p>",

Their mission is to improve the lives of people with DGBI. Over the last 3 decades, the Rome organization has sought to legitimize and update our knowledge of the DGBIs. This has been accomplished by bringing together scientists and clinicians from around the world to classify and critically appraise the science of GI function and dysfunction. This knowledge permits clinical scientists to make recommendations for diagnosis and treatment that can be applied in research and clinical practice. Diagnosis is based on the use of <a href=\"https://theromefoundation.org/rome-iv/rome-iv-criteria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">symptom-based criteria</a> which are used in clinical trials and daily practice.
