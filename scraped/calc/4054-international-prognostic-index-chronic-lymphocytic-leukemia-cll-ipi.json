The patients were randomly divided with 2/3 (2,308) in the training set and 1/3 (1,164) in the validation set. The main endpoint for statistical analysis was overall survival as calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p> <p>After deriving a weighted score based on multivariate Cox regression they calculated a discriminatory statistic c=0.72 (where 1.0 is full discrimination) and the different subgroups' survivals were statistically different from one another. The internal validation confirmed these results.</p> <p>The CLL-IPI was independently validated in two follow-up studies in 2016 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27549308\" target=\"_blank\">Gentile</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27605511\" target=\"_blank\">Da Cunha-Bang</a>). In the first follow-up study, 858 patients from Italy who were not part of clinical trials were used to validate the CLL-IPI and confirmed the previous results; however, most of the patients were not evaluable due to missing data. In the second study, 1,514 patients from a Danish CLL registry were evaluated and confirmed the prognostic value of the CLL-IPI. </p>",

Was there a particular clinical experience or patient encounter that inspired you to create this tool for clinicians?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We developed the CLL-IPI because we realized that the clinical staging systems did not separate high risk patients well enough in the era of new therapies (chemoimmunotherapies) (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797299\" target=\"_blank\">Pflug et al, Blood 2014</a>).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What pearls, pitfalls and/or tips do you have for users of the CLL-IPI? Do you know of cases when it has been applied, interpreted, or used inappropriately?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The score should be applied for prognostication but not for determining treatment indication. As of today, indication for treatment is determined by symptoms of disease (and sometimes clinical staging).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What recommendations do you have for doctors once they have applied the CLL-IPI? Are there any adjustments or updates you would make to the score based on new data or practice changes?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CLL-IPI will be evaluated in the era of novel targeted agents to see whether it applies for patients treated with agents such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, or venetoclax.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you use the CLL-IPI in your own clinical practice? Can you give an example of a scenario in which you use it?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I use it for all CLL patients.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Any other research in the pipeline that you&rsquo;re particularly excited about?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am excited about the potent therapeutic efficacy of novel agents in CLL, and by studies of clonal evolution of CLL under targeted therapies, as well as strategies to prevent it.</p>"
