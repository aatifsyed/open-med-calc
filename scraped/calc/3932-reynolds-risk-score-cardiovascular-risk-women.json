They assessed 35 factors in 24,558 initially healthy women, age 45 and older. Participants were followed for an average of 10.2 years and evaluated for cardiovascular events (MI, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death).</p> <p>Study participants were divided into thirds. Two-thirds (n=16,400) were randomly assigned to a model (A or B) derivation set. The remaining third (n=8,158) were assigned to an independent validation set.</p> <p>A best overall prediction algorithm (model A) was fit from the data using Cox proportional hazards. 43% of all participants assigned to model A, who had a risk score between 5% and &lt;20% based on Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) Guidelines, were reclassified to a lower or higher risk score that more closely matched actual cardiovascular events. 50% of women assigned to model A who did not have diabetes, with a 10-year risk between 5% and &lt;20% based on ATP III, were similarly reclassified to a lower or higher risk score.</p> <p>Model A was clinically simplified to create the Reynolds Risk score (Model B), which showed similar reclassification of 30%-45% (compared to Model A, 43%-50%) of intermediate risk women to higher and lower risk scores.</p> <p>Neither model found significant evidence for reclassification of women at ATP III 10-year very low risk &lt;5%.</p>",
