Points were NOT additive for risk (i.e., mortality was 8.9% in the high risk group whether there was 1 point or 6 points). Each patient was also assigned an <calculator id='1304'>original PESI score</calculator>.</li> <li>Patients were admitted and given <abbr title='Low Molecular Weight Heparin'>LMWH</abbr> and transitioned to oral vitamin K antagonists.
