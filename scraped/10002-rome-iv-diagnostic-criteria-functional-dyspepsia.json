The updated Rome IV was designed to make the criteria easier to use clinically, incorporate investigations where appropriate and psychosocial aspects of these disorders, and improve its applicability to other countries and cultures.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3a01b04e-f8c2-daeb-7f30-4b48efc28a37\">The development of the Rome IV questionnaires began with a survey of 1,162 adults without gastrointestinal disorders to determine the frequency in the US general population of various gastrointestinal symptoms. The 90th percentile of symptom frequency was used to define what was considered abnormal. Based on this, diagnostic questionnaires were created and reviewed by clinical experts. These questionnaires were validated in 843 patients from gastroenterology clinics. In functional dyspepsia, the sensitivity of these criteria was 54.7% and the specificity was 93.3%. &nbsp;</span></p>",

Their mission is to improve the lives of people with DGBI. Over the last 3 decades, the Rome organization has sought to legitimize and update our knowledge of the DGBIs. This has been accomplished by bringing together scientists and clinicians from around the world to classify and critically appraise the science of GI function and dysfunction. This knowledge permits clinical scientists to make recommendations for diagnosis and treatment that can be applied in research and clinical practice. Diagnosis is based on the use of <a href=\"https://theromefoundation.org/rome-iv/rome-iv-criteria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">symptom-based criteria</a> which are used in clinical trials and daily practice.
