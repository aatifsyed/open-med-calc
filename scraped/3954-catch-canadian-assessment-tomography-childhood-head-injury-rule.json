Only 53% patients received a CT.

Given that CATCH, CHALICE and PECARN aim to identify patients at different levels of risk, 949 patients were evaluated to determine the proportion of patients with head injury to which clinical decision rule (CDR) applied. No CDR was applicable to all patients. CHALICE was the most applicable, 95% (95% CI 96&ndash;98%) and CATCH was the least applicable, 26% (95% CI 24&ndash;29%). </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Lyttle 2012</span></a><span>: In a systematic review and assessment of CATCH with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Tool, the authors noted that CATCH was distinctive from CHALICE and PECARN for several reasons: CATCH was the only CDR to perform with 100% sensitivity &nbsp;identifying the primary outcome, it defined intracranial findings on CT as a secondary (not primary) outcome and did not include hospital admission as an outcome unlike the other CDRs, and it collected the fewest predictor variables in its derivation (26 compared to CHALICE and PECARN&rsquo;s 40 and 36, respectively). Kappa values for assessment of clinical variables for all three studies were &gt;0.5. CATCH&rsquo;s derivation was unique in the use of bootstrapping to evaluate the alternative combinations of risk factors, though all three CDRs used recursive partitioning in multivariate analysis.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span>Easter 2014</span></a><span>: This single center prospective observational study compared physician estimation (gestalt prediction of &lt;1% risk of TBI) and practice (actual CT ordering practice) with CATCH, CHALICE and PECARN clinical decision rules on children under 18 with GCS &ge;13 presenting within 24 hours of blunt head injury. PECARN&rsquo;s definition of clinically important TBI (ciTBI) was the primary outcome.
