            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The Pediatric Trauma BIG Score was developed by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21422095\" target=\"_blank\">Borgman et al</a> in 2011 to rapidly assess the severity of illness and predict mortality in pediatric trauma patients. The model score derivation study used the Joint Theater Trauma Registry from 2002 to 2009, which contained pediatric military and civilian data from military treatment facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Univariate analyses were performed on multiple clinical and injury variables associated with mortality. </p> <p>Three variables, the base deficit, international normalized ratio (INR), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were found to be independently predictive of mortality. A model score was then derived using data from 707 pediatric patients and evaluated for mortality by using a receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis. Overall mortality was 8.9% (63 of 707) with a median ISS of 10 (interquartile range: 5-19). The BIG Score yielded an area under the ROC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83-0.95), performing better than the Revised Trauma Score (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI:0.70-0.90), Age-Specific Pediatric Trauma Score (AUROC 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90), Pediatric Age-Adjusted Trauma (AUROC 0.75, 95% CI: 0.64-0.86), and Trauma and Injury Severity Score (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.85). </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21422095\" target=\"_blank\">Borgman et al</a> then externally validated the BIG Score by conducting a separate retrospective analysis of the data of 1,101 pediatric patients obtained from the Trauma Registry of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie from 2002 to 2007. The overall mortality in this population was 11.6% (128 of 1,101) with mean ISS of 24 (±15) and median ISS of 22 (interquartile range: 13-29). The ROC for mortality yielded an area under the curve nearly identical to the derivation study (0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.92). </p> <p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26118931\" target=\"_blank\">Davis et al</a> conducted a validation study of the BIG Score in 621 pediatric blunt trauma patients with ISS≥12 from a single level 1 trauma center in Ontario, Canada. This study adjusted for pre-hospital intubation and volume administration and the presence of hypotension and head injury. AUROC for mortality was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98) with the optimal BIG cutoff of 16. Mortality with BIG Scores &lt;16 was 3/496 (0.006, 95% CI 0.001-0.007) vs. 47/125 (0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.7) for BIG Scores ≥16 with p &lt;0.0001. </p> <p>The authors corroborated the studies by Borgman et al by concluding that the BIG Score remains predictive of mortality in a population of North American pediatric patients with blunt trauma independent of pre-hospital interventions and presence of head injury and hypotension. &nbsp;</p>",
