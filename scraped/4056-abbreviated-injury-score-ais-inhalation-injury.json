            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p>The AIS&nbsp;for inhalation injury was first proposed by Endorf and Gamelli in 2007. The purpose of their study was to identify whether severity of inhalation injury correlated better with pulmonary parameters (e.g. lung compliance, PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio) and acute fluid resuscitation requirements than bronchoscopically assessed inhalation injury severity. They retrospectively reviewed 80 adult patients requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and flexible bronchoscopy for suspected inhalation injury within the first 24 hours of admission. They used the AIS&nbsp;classification to separate their patients into two groups of bronchoscopic inhalation injury: one including grades 0 and 1 and another including grades 2, 3, and 4. They compared characteristics, such as fluid resuscitation requirements, initial oxygenation, lung compliance, and duration of mechanical ventilation; only bronchoscopic severity correlated with decreased survival (<em>p&nbsp;</em>= 0.03).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20006445\" target=\"_blank\">Hassan et al</a> also found a significant (<em>p</em> &lt;0.01) increase in mortality with bronchoscopic severity. They did not use the AIS.</p> <p>Since 2007, a number of studies have used AIS in order to establish a clear relationship between bronchoscopic grade of injury and a range of clinical outcomes; however, the results have been varied. For instance, in contrast to Endorf and Gamelli’s study, Albright et al (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3290689\" target=\"_blank\">2012</a>), Mosier et al (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21941194\" target=\"_blank\">2012</a>), and Spano et al (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594859\" target=\"_blank\">2016</a>) all found that increasing AIS grade did not have a significant effect on mortality, with <em>p</em>-values of 0.21, 0.10, and 0.15, respectively.</p> <p>Albright et al did show that increasing severity was associated with longer ventilator days (<em>p&nbsp;</em>= 0.036) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (<em>p&nbsp;</em>= 0.040). Additionally, Mosier et al noted a significant association between AIS grade severity and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at 24 hours (<em>p</em> &lt;0.01).</p>",
