It was based on risk factors identified in cohorts from Northern California and Oxford, England, optimized to predict the 2-day stroke risk. It was initially validated in independent cohorts from those two locations but has now been validated in many other populations. It works pretty well but is far from perfect. Imaging information, such as whether an acute infarction is present, can also be very useful for prognostication and is not incorporated into the score. Although the score has been incorporated into guidelines for hospital admission and more detailed evaluations, it should not be used in place of clinical judgment. For example, a young person with a history of IV drug use and a new murmur presenting with a brief episode of facial tingling might have an ABCD<sup>2</sup> score of 0 yet may be at high short-term risk of stroke.</p>"
