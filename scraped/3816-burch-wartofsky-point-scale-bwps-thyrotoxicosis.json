American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines (2011) include the BWPS as diagnostic criteria for thyroid storm.</p>\n<p>The Japanese Thyroid Association (Akamizu et al) published an alternative system derived from literature review of thyroid storm cases and Japanese patients with thyroid storm in 2012. The Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA) criteria categorize patients based on aggregate presence of certain clinical features (CNS, fever, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, GI). In the JTA guidelines, a &ldquo;definite&rdquo; diagnosis of thyroid storm requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At least 1 CNS symptom plus &ge; 1 other symptoms OR</li>\n<li>&ge; 3 symptoms other than CNS manifestations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, comparison of JTA criteria to BWPS demonstrated that of the 406 patients diagnosed of thyroid storm or impending/possible thyroid storm, 354 were identified as such by both scoring systems. Although these 2 scoring systems are mostly concordant, 41 additional patients were found to qualify for treatment by the BWPS, suggesting that the application of BWPS may lead to more aggressive treatment approach.</p>",
