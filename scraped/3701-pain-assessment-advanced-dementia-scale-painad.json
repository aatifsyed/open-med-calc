Each patient was scored by the principal investigator and two other raters (from a pool of six). Adequate levels of interrater reliability were found between each dyad. The PAINAD score correlated well with the Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type, and there was a statistically significant decrease in score after administration of analgesics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The PAINAD scale was validated in twenty-five elderly patients hospitalized for surgical repair of a hip fracture; twelve were cognitively impaired while thirteen were intact. The PAINAD scale was positively correlated with a self-reported scale, demonstrating concurrent validity, and scores were higher when patients were likely to experience pain than when unlikely, demonstrating discriminant validity.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-dddf6187-7fff-e158-4ebf-c5e10bfc0411\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The PAINAD scale was prospectively validated by Mosele et al by application to six hundred patients consecutively admitted to the acute geriatric section at Padua University (Italy). It was internally reliable, and had better concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability than a self-reported numerical rating scale.</p>",
