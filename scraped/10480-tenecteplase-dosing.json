            "evidence_based_medicine_en": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Currently, alteplase is the only FDA-approved treatment option for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, alteplase is limited by a cumbersome administration technique (an IV bolus followed by a 60-minute infusion). Tenecteplase (TNK) poses multiple pharmacologic advantages over alteplase including more fibrin-specificity (theoretically may lead to less bleeding), a longer half-life and greater resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1); the latter two characteristics enable TNK to be administered as a single IV bolus.</span><b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In 2005, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20185783/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haley et al.</a> first examined TNK for use in AIS patients. This dose ranging study examined the safety (intracranial hemorrhage - ICH) of escalating doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg. TNK doses of 0.5 mg/kg led to higher rates of ICH. Overall, TNK doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg produced similar functional outcomes compared with historical alteplase patients.</span><b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Since initial dose escalation studies, multiple trials have examined TNK dosing as well as safety and efficacy versus alteplase in various stroke populations. Based on data from RCTs, TNK appears to have similar efficacy as alteplase. In <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28952914/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EXTEND-IA TNK</a>, patients with large vessel occlusions and planned thrombectomy who received TNK had improved vessel reperfusion versus alteplase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Several studies have attempted to clarify the best dose of TNK. Notably, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32078683/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EXTEND-IA TNK II</a> compared doses of 0.4 mg/kg (max dose of 40 mg) and 0.25 mg/kg (max dose of 25 mg). No difference in ICH was seen between the two doses, however, there was also no difference in rate of vessel reperfusion rates or 90-day functional outcomes (mRS). This suggests no benefit to using the TNK 0.4 mg/kg. Use of lower TNK doses (0.25 mg/kg) was solidified with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35525250/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NOR-TEST 2, Part A</a> which compared TNK 0.4 mg/kg to standard doses of alteplase and found worse functional outcomes and higher rates of ICH.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TNK has been incorporated into multiple stroke guidelines. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AHA/ASA 2019 stroke guidelines</a>, TNK may be used as an alternative to alteplase in patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (max 25 mg). The <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33817340/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Stroke Association</a> suggests use of TNK over alteplase in patients eligible for mechanical thrombectomy. The <a href=\"https://informme.org.au/guidelines/living-clinical-guidelines-for-stroke-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Australian Stroke Foundation</a> recommends either thrombolytic may be used for patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. Current guideline recommendations (published prior to several large RCTs) are more ubiquitous for patients with mild stroke or those not undergoing thrombectomy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A summary of select RCT data is provided below. Note multiple trials are ongoing which should help clarify TNK&rsquo;s place in therapy. All trials included in the tables below allowed an IV thrombolytic to be administered up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset, with the exception of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22435369/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parsons et al.</a> (6 hours), and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36549308/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TWIST</a> (4.5 hours of awakening).&nbsp; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34429364/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TRACE</a> and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36774935/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TRACE-2</a> are not included in the summary table. These trials focused specifically on the East Asian population to confirm the safety of TNK in these patients. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34429364/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TRACE</a> found no difference in safety in examined TNK doses (0.1, 0.25, 0.32 mg/kg). <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36774935/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TRACE-2</a> found TNK 0.25 mg/kg was non-inferior to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients not undergoing thrombectomy.&nbsp;</span></p>",
