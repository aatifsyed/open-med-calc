The primary outcome evaluated was all-cause, 30-day hospital readmission.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two separate acute MI&nbsp;models were derived and internally validated from a list of candidate variables that were chosen based on previously published multi-condition readmission models, as well as clinical variables (e.g. comorbidities, markers of severity, laboratory results, etc) hypothesized to be likely predictors of adverse outcomes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the &ldquo;full-stay&rdquo; model had slightly better discrimination, it did not significantly improve reclassification and was unable to be calculated until the time of discharge; the authors determined that the &ldquo;first-day&rdquo; or Acute MI READMITS Score was a more useful tool for clinicians. The Acute MI READMITS Score includes&nbsp;seven variables available within 24 hours of admission, allowing early risk assessment and institution of readmission reduction strategies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Acute MI READMITS Score demonstrated good overall discrimination (C-statistic 0.75, 95% CI, 0.70&ndash;0.80; optimism-corrected C-statistic 0.73, 95% CI, 0.71&ndash;0.7) and outperformed previously published multi-condition models and the CMS acute MI&nbsp;administrative model. However, the Acute MI READMITS model does demonstrate a modest overestimation of risk in the highest and lowest quintiles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Acute MI READMITS score has yet to be externally validated.</p>",
