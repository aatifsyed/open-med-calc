The serum digoxin level may be misleadingly high if obtained &lt;6 hours after ingestion.</li>\n<li>Digoxin levels measured after administration of DigiFab will be falsely elevated. If required, <em>free</em> digoxin levels will need to be measured (not readily available at all labs).</li>\n<li>Hyperkalemia acts as a marker of poisoning severity in acute digoxin overdose. Correcting mild elevations in serum potassium without administering DigiFab will <em>not</em> improve survival (see Next Steps for details).</li>\n<li>Impaired creatinine clearance and aging (associated with decreased function of renal, hepatic, and cardiac systems) may result in clinical toxicity at lower serum digoxin levels.</li>\n<li>Electrolyte abnormalities (specifically hypokalemia, but including hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia) may result in dysrhythmias at lower serum digoxin levels.</li>\n<li>Drugs including quiNIDine, verapamil, dilTIAZem, carvedilol, amiodarone, and spironolactone will result in decreased digoxin protein binding, thereby increasing free digoxin levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tips from the creator:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The calculator is appropriate for vials containing (approximately) 40 mg of antibodies.</li>\n<li>Slow infusion (i.e., 2 hours) improves Fab efficacy.
