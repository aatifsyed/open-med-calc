If negative no US was performed. 16% of the control group and 15.5 percent of the test group had DVT or PE resulting in overall incidence of 15.7%.</li>\n<li>Of the 520 control patients, 279 were considered DVT unlikely, and 241 were DVT likely. 16 (5.7%) of the unlikely patients had DVT or PE. In the control group overall, 6 (1.4%) patients who had been initially ruled out had a diagnosis of DVT on 3 month follow-up.</li>\n<li>Of the 562 patients in the d-dimer group, 315 were considered unlikely and 247 considered likely to have DVT. 71 (28.7%) of the likely group had DVT. 38.8 percent of the unlikely group had a negative d-dimer and did not undergo further testing. 2 of these patients (0.4%) had confirmed DVT on 4 and 14 d follow-up. The negative predictive value of d-dimer was 96.1%.</li>\n<li>This algorithm was then supported by Scarvelis and Wells in 2006 (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17060659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scarvelis 2006</a>).</li>\n<li>A systematic review (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16403932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wells 2006</a>) was performed in 2006 which evaluated 14 studies with 8239 patients that used the Wells score to predict risk of DVT and evaluated for incidence of DVT in association with moderate or high sensitivity d-dimer.

This is the most common mistake made. Also, never never do the D-dimer first [before history and physical exam]. The monster in the box is that the D-dimer is done first and is positive (as it is for many patients with non-VTE conditions) and then the physician assumes that VTE is now possible and then the model is done. Do the history and physical exam first and decide if VTE is a diagnostic possibility!</p><p><strong>Dr. Wells on testing in medicine for MDCalc:</strong></p><p>The importance of Clinical pretest probability is underutilized in medicine. Recognizing the power of a simple concept, derived essentially from Bayes theorem, that discordance between the clinical PTP and the test result should raise suspicion of a false negative test (if high PTP) or false positive test (if low PTP), we sought to derive prediction rules for suspected DVT and for suspected PE.
