There was central pathology review in 95% of cases. Patients were followed for 7–64 months after 6–8 cycles of R-CHOP. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were calculated using conventional IPI for comparison. Risk factors were then redistributed to create a more meaningful stratification grouping.</p> <p>The utility of the R-IPI has been validated in the following studies:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260224\" target=\"_blank\">El-Galaly et al 2015</a>:</li> <ul> <li>Authors also looked at impact of PET staging, not routinely used during IPI/R-IPI development, for prognosis, and concluded R-IPI showed high accuracy in PET era as well.</li> </ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054914\" target=\"_blank\">Olszewski et al 2015</a>:</li> <ul> <li>The R-IPI validated via cancer registry data of 19,511 patients (of 119,942 patient pool). Noted that the IPI and R-IPI account for only 16% of survival variation, suggesting molecular markers be evaluated and incorporated into future prognostic indexes.</li> </ul> <li><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/21/7/1486/163863/Prognostic-models-for-diffuse-large-B-cell\" target=\"_blank\">Bari et al 2010</a>:</li> <ul> <li>Retrospective study of 831 patients from two Italian registries. Confirmed IPI less useful in rituximab era, and validated use of R-IPI, noting still did poorly in worst prognosis patients.</li> </ul> </ul> <p>The original and validation articles address the lack of recognition of the poorest prognosis patients, and this is an area of active research.</p>",
