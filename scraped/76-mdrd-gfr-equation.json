The derivation cohort included 1070 patients and the validation cohort 558 patients. The equation has since been validated more extensively in a variety of populations, though it remains useful primarily for patients with impaired kidney function (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m). The equation has not been validated in patients greater than 70 years old, though it is still applied in these patients. Additional modifications exist for use in certain populations, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18037093/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including East Asian populations</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-faf22306-7fff-fe96-54c5-d9b3c5eb44a1\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Debate has arisen regarding the use of the adjustment coefficient for black patients.
