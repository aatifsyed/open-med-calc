Because referrals were predominantly from ED attendances or other institutions (i.e., referrals typically because a simple peripheral etiology to vertigo was not apparent on assessment by a non-neuro-ophthalmologist), the cohort was older (mean 62 years), mostly male (65%), and overall at higher risk of vascular disease (70% had &ge;2 stroke risk factors). Most were seen after 24 hours of symptom onset, with a mean examination time for the entire cohort of 26 hours. Acute MRI was performed in 97%, with repeat imaging at 2-10 days for the 8 patients with central localization but initial negative MRI for stroke. Peripheral localization was confirmed with caloric testing. 76 patients were found to have a central lesion, and overall the authors found the HINTS examination to be 100% sensitive and 96% specific. For comparison, the sensitivity of early MRI (&lt;48 hours) for brainstem infarction was 72%.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the initial work, the same authors re-analyzed the tool in comparison with the <calculator id=\"357\">ABCD&sup2; Score for TIA</calculator> in the same cohort after a longer period of study, thereby including a higher number of patients (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24127701\" target=\"_blank\">Newman-Toker 2013</a>). This found a comparable sensitivity (96.8%) and specificity (98.5%) for any central cause.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An important limitation of these initial studies includes the assessment being performed by a specialist neuro-ophthalmologist, making it difficult to generalize the high sensitivities of the testing to non-subspecialist practitioners.</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-059f4184-7fff-3ee6-98e8-1accb5c97345\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511453\" target=\"_blank\">Kerber et al (2015)</a> then re-evaluated the HINTS examination in a larger cohort (272 patients) with a more diverse demographic (stroke comprised only 10.7% of the final diagnoses compared to 68% in the initial HINTS study) and a broader range of examiners (including a vascular neurologist and emergency physician). This found a lower sensitivity, with a 5.9% risk of missed stroke with HINTS alone. The authors recommended a more nuanced approach using a combination of vascular risk factors (<calculator id=\"357\">ABCD&sup2; Score</calculator>), general neurological examination, and MRI imaging to optimize the differentiation of stroke and other vestibular diagnoses.</p>",
